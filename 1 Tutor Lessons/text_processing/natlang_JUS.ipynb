      "5.1\tConfiguration\n",
      "BSAS created a SP2010 lab environment for the Gap Analysis.  It was installed according to the standard installation instructions that come with SP2010.  The BA Team asked that all functionality be enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "As testing progressed, additional support was sought from BSAS and eventually Microsoft.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For some of the FRs, the challenge was not the ability of SP2010 to do the function, it was the technical setup of the lab environment.  These were usually simple to correct once identified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of particular note, this evaluation is limited to what is available in the SP2010 license itself.  SP2010 must be able to meet the requirement without Addons or customization.  This is true even for the requirements worded alone or in conjunction with other systems.  The BA Team felt that no useful evaluation would have been possible if an indefinite list of possible Addons were included.  All FRs would have passed because somewhere out there someone probably has a system or could create one that could cause SP2010 to meet the requirement.  By limiting the evaluation to what is available with the purchase of an SP2010 license, the knowledge of what the SP2010 offering can provide is known and reported on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are a few FRs where the functionality required is more about the EDRMS being able to integrate than it is about functionality being delivered by an Addon.  These have been passed and an indication given that they were not fully tested. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Addon information has been included in the Group Notes whenever Microsoft named a specific Addon that could provide the additional functionality.  The Addons have not been tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2\tProcess\n",
      "SP2010 was evaluated against the JUS IM System Requirements 2011 through testing done by the BA Team.  The BA Team evaluated the requirements to the best of their ability and, where necessary, sought additional information from Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yes/No Rating indicates whether the functional or metadata requirement has been met at all by SP2010.  The Rating Scale (A+ to Fails) gives a subjective indicator of how well SP2010 meets the requirement.  The entire evaluation took place over several weeks.  Having all members of the BA Team available at all times was not possible but there were always at least two people on the BA Team involved in the evaluation of every requirement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where JUS would like to see improvement in SP2010 related to the requirement, this has been flagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BA Team included Robert Sguin, Derek Auger, Bryan Dewar, Josette Gaudreault, Krysta, St.Amand, and Angelique Everitt.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The BSAS resource assigned to create and support the environment was Francisco Braga.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCase representatives were consulted as necessary during the evaluation of iCase metadata and functional requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft was given the opportunity to review the failing items before the report was finalized. Microsoft attended several meetings and provided input as to how FRs could be met with SP2010.  The input received from them has been included.  They were unable to provide the resources to review and feedback on the GCRMFRs but they did review all other FRs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3\tAppendix C  Other Requirements\n",
      "The Other Requirements in Appendix C are not the typical requirements one finds in gap analyses.  These are requirements coming out of information management policies and directives.  They are usually more like statements of responsibility and no system can be evaluated against them.  A few are system-related and they have been identified in Appendix C.  The evaluation of most of these Other Requirements did not lend itself to the same Yes/No rating that worked for the Functional and Metadata Requirements so an explanation of how JUS is complying with the requirement has been provided by the various areas in IMSD responsible for these requirements.  The 7 system-related ones are reported on in 4.7 above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.0 \tChallenges Encountered \n",
      "There were a variety of challenges encountered on the way to producing this Gap Analysis.  The following provides a brief overview of the main ones in chronological order:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1\t Environment for the Gap Analysis\n",
      "It was several months of negotiating with TSD before an environment was made available for the IM Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 SP2010 Knowledge\n",
      "There was no training for the BA Team prior to starting the Gap Analysis.  Through the use of manuals and the vast Internet resources available on the subject of SharePoint, the BA Team was able to get about 70% of the FRs tested to their satisfaction.  For the remaining 30%, it was difficult to know if the system could not meet the requirement or the inability to find a way to meet the requirement was due to the lack of expertise or administrative privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, Microsofts review of the FRs was essential to the completion of the Gap Analysis.  There feedback was reviewed and the relevant FRs tested then the Gap Analysis was modified as appropriate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 ISO16175 Challenges\n",
      "Working with the ISO Standards was often quite difficult.  Terminology was the biggest problem.  The language used in 16175-2 is especially confusing when it comes to aggregations.  All of the following terms are used: aggregations, non-digital aggregations, digital aggregations, hybrid aggregations, hybrid non-digital aggregations, and hybrid digital aggregations.  Where the BAs involved in the Gap Analysis could agree on the likely meaning, the FR was evaluated.  For several of the FRs the meaning was so well hidden that the FR remains unevaluated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other challenge with the ISO Standards is the relationship amongst systems assumed by the Standards.  For these ISO Standards, the 16175-2 Module deals with finalized records in an ERMS and 16175-3 deals with in-process records in the DMS.  The assumption is that records are passed to the ERMS once finalized or in order to be finalized.  This does not match the physical reality of SP2010 which can lifecycle the records in the DMS.  This disconnect between the model assumed by the Standards and the reality of the solution being evaluated does make the evaluation process a bit muddier than it could be.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another difficulty was that there were differences in definitions between the -2 and -3 documents.  Sometimes things were defined differently.  Sometimes they were defined in one document but not the other.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A report listing the difficulties in understanding the ISO16175 documents has been shared with Brian Thurgood, LAC.  He participates in the ICA/ADRI and ISO committees responsible for authoring and maintaining the standards.  There is no estimated time of arrival for feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.4 Inability to Fully Test all Functional Requirements\n",
      "Many of the FRs make very specific demands about functionality that would only be possible to fully test if time and other resources were not an issue.  For the following groups of FRs, here is how we handled reporting:\n",
      "* There are some reports available out of the box but there is no report designing functionality built into SP2010.  For FRs that would require the development of a new report, the FRs have failed.  There is one report that is available out-of-the-box that does not work in the Gap environment.

      "1 INTRODUCTION \n",
      "Good management of records and information is fundamental to a well-functioning organisation since it supports business activity and provides a basis for efficient service delivery. It also provides the mechanism whereby both the private and public sectors can account for their decisions and actions. Records provide evidence for the public to confirm or claim their public rights and entitlements, as well as providing individuals with evidence to justify government decisions and a mechanism whereby they can have trust in private enterprise. Moreover, good records management is simply good business practice. \n",
      "Records management systems facilitate: \n",
      "\n",
      " efficiency, by making information readily available when needed for decision-making and operational activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " sound use of financial resources, by allowing timely disposal of non-current records; \n",
      "\n",
      " accountability, by enabling the creation of a complete and authoritative record of official activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " compliance, by demonstrating that legal requirements have been met; and \n",
      "\n",
      " risk mitigation, by managing the risks associated with illegal loss or destruction of records, and from inappropriate or unauthorised access to records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Scope \n",
      "A fundamental underlying principle is the distinction between business information systems (business systems) and electronic records management systems. Business systems contain data that is commonly subject to constant updates (dynamic), able to be transformed (manipulable) and only contain current data (non-redundant). By contrast, electronic records management systems contain data that is not dynamically linked to business activity (fixed), unable to be altered (inviolable), and may be non-current (redundant). Therefore business systems are beyond the scope of this Module (see Module 3: Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Records in Business Systems). The records within an electronic records management system are, however, still dynamic in the sense that they can be (re)used in new business activity/contexts, so new metadata will be added through the ongoing use of the record content. It is more appropriate to speak about a framework for the systematic and structured management of records; records management systems link records to business activities, retain records of past actions, and fix the content and structure of records over time. \n",
      "The scope of this Module is limited to products that are usually termed electronic records management systems. It does not seek to set requirements for records still in use within business systems. Digital objects created by email, word processing, spreadsheet and imaging applications (such as text documents, and still and moving images), where they are identified to be of business value, should be managed within electronic records management systems that meet the functional requirements in this Module. [1]Records managed by an electronic records management system may be stored on a variety of different media formats, and may be managed in hybrid record aggregations that include both electronic and non-electronic elements. \n",
      "This Module does not attempt to include requirements that are not specific to, or necessary for, records management, for example, general system management and design requirements. Nor does it include requirements common to all software applications, such as the performance, scalability and usability of the application. [2]Given the target audience of this document, it also assumes a level of knowledge about developing design specifications, procurement and evaluation processes, and therefore these issues are not covered in this Module. Although not included in this Modules requirements, the importance of non-records management functional requirements for records management systems is recognised through their inclusion in the high-level model outlined in Section 2.3: Overview of functional requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specifications for the long-term preservation of electronic records are also beyond the scope of this Module as this issue should be addressed separately by a dedicated strategy for digital preservation or electronic archiving. These electronic archiving considerations transcend the life of systems and are system independent; they need to be assessed in a specific longer-term strategic framework. However, recognition of the need to maintain records for as long as they are required must be addressed, and potential migration or format obsolescence issues should also be considered. Specific policies and procedures for these should be developed to support the longevity of records for permanent or long-term retention. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Purpose \n",
      "This Module articulates a set of functional requirements for electronic records management systems. These requirements apply to records irrespective of the media in which they were created and stored. They are intended to: \n",
      "\n",
      " explain processes and requirements for identifying and managing records in electronic records management systems; \n",
      "\n",
      " develop requirements for records management functionality to be included in a design specification when building, upgrading or purchasing electronic records management systems software; \n",
      "\n",
      " inform records management functional requirements in the selection of commercially available electronic records management systems; and \n",
      "\n",
      " review the records management functionality or assess compliance of existing electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Module has been developed as part of an International Council on Archives project designed to: \n",
      "\n",
      " assist organisations to improve electronic records management practices; \n",
      "\n",
      " reduce the duplication of effort and associated costs in identifying a minimum level of records management functionality for electronic records management systems; and \n",
      " establish greater standardisation of records management requirements for software vendors across different jurisdictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Audience \n",
      "The primary audience for this document is staff responsible for designing, reviewing and/or implementing electronic records management systems in organisations  whether those systems are commercial off-the-shelf electronic records management software applications, or custom-built applications. This Module primarily addresses the requirements of organisational records managers or system procurement project leaders, but will be relevant for jurisdictional standard-setters and the wider records management community. Another key audience is software vendors and developers who market and/or develop electronic records management system products. This Module is intended to inform their decision-making when designing records management functionality within electronic records management products. \n",
      "Given the primary target audience for this document, the authors have tried to minimise the use of specific records management terminology. Where the use of such terminology is necessary, definitions can be found in the Glossary at Appendix A. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Related standards \n",
      "Under its Electronic Records and Automation Priority Area, the International Council on Archives has developed a suite of guidelines and functional requirements as part of the Principles and Functional Requirements for Records in Electronic Office Environments project: \n",
      "\n",
      " Module 1: Overview and Statement of Principles; \n",
      "\n",

      "This document forms Module 2 of the project. It has been developed with the support of the Australasian Digital Recordkeeping Initiative. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it is intended to serve as a stand-alone resource, for a broader understanding of the context and principles that have informed its development, readers should refer to Module 1: Overview and Statement of Principles. For details of appropriate functional requirements for (line of) business (information) systems, readers should refer to Module 3: Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Records in Business Systems. \n",

      "Readers of this document should also take note of any relevant jurisdiction-specific standards and specifications. \n",
      "Note: this module is not intended to over-ride any local or jurisdiction-specific legislation standards or requirements. \n",

      "\n",
      "[4]1.5 Terminology \n",
      "Many of the terms used in this document have differing definitions across disciplines. For example, the term archive may mean a storage of little-used data in a database to an IT audience, whereas it means the retention of fixed appraised information no longer retained for current business use within the records management discipline. It is therefore important that this document is read in conjunction with the Glossary at Appendix A. A number of the central concepts used in this document are also outlined below, to avoid misinterpretation: \n",
      "\n",
      " Records  information created, received and maintained as evidence and information by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.1 They provide evidence of business transactions and can exist in any format.   \n",
      "1 International Standard on Records Management, ISO 15489. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Records management  the control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposal of records in accordance with professional and international standards of practice. Records management is distinct from document management, which is typically concerned with the provision of access, collaborative working and version control of documents, rather than the management of authenticity, reliability, integrity and useability over time. \n",
      "\n",
      " Electronic records management systems (commonly referred to as EDRMS or ERMS)  systems specifically designed to manage the maintenance and disposition of records. They maintain the content, context, structure and links between records to enable their accessibility and support their value as evidence. Electronic records management systems are distinguished from business systems, for the purpose of this document, because their primary function is the management of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Business systems  automated systems that create or manage data about an organisations activities (for the purpose of this document). They include applications whose primary purpose is to facilitate transactions between an organisational unit and its customers, for example, an e-commerce system, client-relationship management system, purpose-built or customised database, and finance or human resources systems. Business systems typically contain dynamic data that is commonly subject to constant updates (timely), able to be transformed (manipulable) and holds current data (non-redundant). For the purpose of this document, business systems exclude electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      " System  use of the term system in this document refers to a computer or IT system. This is in contrast to the records management understanding of the term, which encompasses the broader aspects of people, policies, procedures and practices. While the focus of this Module is primarily electronic records management systems software, organisations will need to pay attention to wider aspects of records management frameworks, policies and tools to ensure records can be appropriately managed. For example, fundamental records management tools, such as disposition authorities and information security classifications, must be in place and operate within an established records management culture within the organisation. A system may comprise more than one application and include plug-ins. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata  an inextricable part of records management, serving a variety of functions and purposes. In a records management context, metadata is defined as data describing the context, content and structure of records and their management through time (ISO 15489  1: 2001, 3.12). As such, metadata is structured or semi-structured information that enables the creation, registration, classification, access, preservation and disposition of records through time and within and across domains. Records management metadata can be used to identify, authenticate and contextualise records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them, and the policies that govern them. Initially, metadata defines the record at its point of capture, fixing the record into its business context and establishing management control over it. During the existence of records or their aggregates, new layers of metadata will be added because of new roles in other business or usage contexts. This means that metadata continues to accrue information relating to the context of the records management and the business processes in which the records are used, and to structural changes to the record or its appearance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata can be sourced or re-used by multiple systems and for multiple purposes. Metadata applied to records during their active life may also continue to apply when the records cease to be required for current business purposes but are retained for ongoing research or other values. The purpose of records management metadata is to ensure authenticity, reliability, usability and integrity over time, and to enable the management and understanding of information objects, whether these are physical, analogue or electronic. However, metadata also needs to be managed as a record or as a component of a record. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records management has always involved the management of metadata. However, the electronic environment requires a different expression of traditional requirements and different mechanisms for identifying, capturing, attributing and using metadata. In the electronic environment, authoritative records are those accompanied by metadata defining their critical characteristics. These characteristics must be explicitly documented rather than being implicit, as in some paper-based processes. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.6 Structure \n",
      "This document is divided into four main parts: \n",
      "\n",

      "2.1 What are records and why are they important? \n",
      "Records are a valuable business asset. One of the key ways organisations are held accountable for their actions is through evidence of business transactions in the form of records. Records are information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information, by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.2 They must be retained for a period of time that is in line with an authorised retention schedule or disposition authority, sometimes referred to as a disposition. \n",
      "A record is not just a collection of data, but is the consequence or product of an event and therefore linked to business activities. A distinguishing feature of records is that their content must exist in a fixed form, that is, be a fixed representation of the business transaction. Managing records in business systems, which contain data that is frequently updated and dynamic, is particularly challenging and may provide a rationale for implementing a separate electronic records management system. Records comprise not only content but also information about the context and structure of the record. Records management metadata identifies, authenticates and contextualises records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them and the policies that govern them.3 It allows records to be located, rendered and understood in a meaningful way. ISO/TS 23081  2 provides a generic statement of records management metadata elements. Organisations may also have jurisdiction-specific elements sets to which they must adhere. \n",
      "An appropriately managed record will provide a basis for: \n",
      "\n",
      " transparent, informed and quality decision-making and planning; \n",
      "\n",
      " an information resource that can be used to demonstrate and account for organisational activities; and \n",
      "\n",
      " consistency, continuity and efficiency in administration and management. \n",
      "\n",
      "The International Standard on Records Management, ISO 15489, provides best-practice guidance on how records should be managed to ensure they are authentic, reliable, complete, unaltered and usable. Organisations that do not employ an electronic records management system may risk loss of key evidence of their business activities, thereby resulting in a lack of corporate memory, inefficiency and an inability to meet accountability and legislative requirements.

      "\n",
      "2.2 Characteristics of electronic records and electronic records management systems \n",
      "Once records have been created, they must be managed and maintained for as long as required to ensure they have the following characteristics:4\n",
      "\n",
      " Authenticity  the record can be proven to be what it purports to be, to have been created or sent by the person that created or sent it, and to have been created or sent at the time it is purported to have occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      " Reliability  the record can be trusted as a full and accurate representation of the transaction(s) to which they attest, and can be depended on in the course of subsequent transactions. \n",
      "\n",
      " Integrity  the record is complete and unaltered, and protected against unauthorised alteration. This characteristic is also referred to as inviolability. \n",
      "\n",
      " Usability  the record can be located, retrieved, preserved and interpreted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, electronic records management systems have the following attributes that seek to ensure these characteristics are maintained: \n",
      "\n",
      " Creating records in context  electronic records management systems enable organisations to capture evidence of their business activity. This involves identifying a set of electronic information to serve as the evidential record comprising both content and context. So, in order for information to have the capability of functioning as a record, it is necessary to augment that content information with additional data (that is, metadata) that places it in the context of the business operations and computing environment in which it was created. \n",
      "\n",
      " Managing and maintaining records  electronic records have to be actively managed as evidence of business activity, and to maintain their authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability. Maintenance of this evidence, as records, is necessary for operational viability and accountability of the organisation. \n",
      "\n",
      " Maintaining records for as long as they are required  records must be retained for a period of time that is in accordance with authorised legislative and jurisdictional requirements. Decisions about how long records must be retained are defined in disposition/disposal policies and rules. There will be some records that must be retained permanently while others will be required to be retained for varying periods or have a maximum retention period (for example, for privacy or data-protection legislative purposes). \n",
      "\n",
      "Records have to be able to be disposed of in a managed, systematic and auditable way. A hallmark of appropriate records management is the retention and appropriate disposition of records according to specified rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "Systems need to be able to delete records in a systematic, auditable and accountable way in line with operational and juridical requirements. Organisations will need to meet the policies and procedures of their local jurisdictional authority for identifying, retaining and disposing of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata can be configured  to be meaningful as evidence of a business process, records must be linked to the context of their creation and use. To do this, the record must be associated with metadata about the business context in a classification structure. In addition to this classification metadata, other metadata that should be captured at the point of creation includes: \n",
      " identifier; \n",
      " date of creation; \n",
      " creator/author/person responsible; and \n",
      " the business being conducted. \n",
      "Much of this information can be automatically generated. In this Module, integration of metadata for managing records is addressed at a relatively high level. Rather than specifically detailing every metadata element required, the functional requirements set instead provides broad references to the need to have functionality that is capable of creating, capturing and maintaining adequate metadata elements. It is expected that each organisation will capture records management metadata in line with an identified records management metadata standard, in accordance with organisational and/or jurisdictional requirements, and/or be consistent with ISO 23081  1: 2006, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 1  Principles; and ISO/TS 23081  2: 2007, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 2  Conceptual and Implementation Issues. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records can be reassigned or reclassified, closed and if required, duplicated and extracted  the identification of needs for records should establish at what point in the process a record should be created. Any further processes that happen to the record after this point must result in the creation of a new record or the recorded augmentation/versioning of the existing record, rather than alteration to it. This means that content and metadata that need to be kept to record previous decisions or processes cannot be overwritten, but that new content or metadata can be added. \n",
      "It is important to ensure that the system is not locked down to such an extent that simple mistakes (such as mistyping a name) cannot be corrected  although permission for changes may be restricted to a system administrator or prevented by the system in exceptional circumstances, such as pending legal action. \n",
      "\n",
      " Reports can be undertaken  on records and the management thereof. \n",
      "\n",
      " Security processes can be put in place  normal systems controls over access and security support the maintenance of authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability, and therefore should be appropriately documented. \n",
      "\n",
      "A risk assessment can inform business decisions as to how rigorous the controls need to be. For example, in a high-risk environment, it may be necessary to prove exactly what happened, when and by whom. This links to systems permissions and audit logging, to prove that approved actions are undertaken by authorised users. User requirements should be assigned at appropriate levels of access by an administrator. \n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1: System levels of access \n",
      "User \n",
      "Any person with permission to access the electronic records management system. That is, anyone who creates, receives, reviews and/or uses records stored in the system. This is the standard level of access that most employees of an organisation will possess. \n",
      "Authorised user \n",
      "A user with special access permissions that allow additional access to, and/or control over, records contained in the electronic records management system. Authorised users may in some instances be assigned permissions to undertake tasks similar to those of the system administrator, such as the ability to close and re-open records, create extracts of records and edit record metadata. The powers assigned to authorised users will vary depending on the business needs of the organisation and the level of responsibility allotted to the authorised user. \n",
      "Records administrator (or records manager) \n",
      "A system administrator, usually the records manager, with designated responsibility for configuring, monitoring and managing the electronic records management system content and its use. \n",
      "System administrator (IT) \n",
      "A person with responsibility for assigning and removing the permissions allocated to users and authorised users. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 Supporting import, export and interoperability \n",
      "The ability to import and export records, and interoperability with other systems, is frequently required functionality. Records may need to be exported to other organisations in the event of mergers or government re-organisational changes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many records may need to be retained for longer than the lifespan of the software system itself, and therefore there is a need to be able to export records when transitioning to a new electronic records management system. There may also be a need to import records from business systems, particularly in collaborative business environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "For ease of import and export, use of open formats and industry standards will increase levels of interoperability and reduce the cost and difficulty of any import/export process. \n",
      "\n",
      "This functionality must be addressed at the planning stages as part of the business requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.2 Authentication, encryption and technological protection measures \n",
      "These issues have an impact on the reliability of records issue. Electronic records management systems must allow records to be effectively managed when they have been subject to technological protection measures, electronic signatures and electronic watermarks (digital rights management). They should give particular consideration to the ongoing maintenance of records that have been subject to encryption and digital signatures. While encryption and digital signatures have a valuable role to play in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of records in transmission, they also present risks to the ongoing useability of the record as decryption keys and public keys for digital signatures may expire while the record is still required. For this reason, storing records in encrypted form is not recommended. Metadata can record the encryption and decryption processes and attest to the successful decryption of records. \n",
      "\n",
      "If digital signatures are used as a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of records, key management must be considered. Information about the digital signature and its validation should be recorded within the metadata. \n",

      "2.3 Overview of functional requirements \n",
      "This section identifies and briefly describes the functional requirements using a high-level model that clusters the requirements to highlight their inter-relationships (Figure 1).

      "\n",
      "2.3.1 Create \n",
      "Capture \n",
      "Electronic records management systems uniquely capture, classify and identify records to ensure that their content, structure and context of creation are fixed in time and space. These records management processes facilitate the making of complete, authentic and usable records. There should be functionality to create a new record by reusing the content, structure and context of records once captured. While version/document control is beyond the scope of this Module it may also provide some of this functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records aggregations \n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records are accumulations of related electronic record entities that, when combined, may exist at a level above that of a singular electronic record object, for example, a file. Aggregations represent relationships that exist between related electronic records and the system or environment in which they were created, and are recorded in their metadata links and/or other associations. These aggregations are typically controlled within a classification scheme in an electronic records management system. \n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic records management systems may contain aggregations of records, records that are not aggregated, or both. Records aggregations structure related electronic records and support their management and usability. They may be at more than one level, and may have multiple relationships within separate aggregations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records may reflect relationships such as shared characteristics or attributes, or the existence of sequential relationships between related electronic records. The nature of the relationship between the electronic records of a particular aggregation will vary depending on factors such as their purpose and structure, and the content and format of the records themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an aggregation of electronic records may collectively constitute a narrative of events (that is, a series of connected business transactions), in which the records may have a sequential relationship. Any such sequential relationship between electronic records can be determined through the metadata elements associated with the records, such as titles, dates, author, container number (where applicable), and other such attributes. Where these relationships exist between records imported or extracted from external business systems, the electronic records management system should be capable of identifying, capturing, documenting and preserving them. \n",
      "These aggregations may be formal, structured relationships (for example, digital files containing related digital documents), or may exist as less formalised, tightly bound metadata relationships recognised as establishing links between related records within an aggregation. \n",
      "The aggregations must be fixed and maintained over time. Any change to an aggregation must be logged with an explanation. Aggregation for the management of records purposes should not be confused with, or replaced by, the generation of multiple, different aggregations in response to search requests or report queries. \n",
      "Figure 2: Aggregation of records \n",
      "Identification (registration) \n",
      "To verify their existence within the system, every record and associated aggregation must have a unique identifier persistently linked to it. This allows the user to locate records and helps them to distinguish between versions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Classification \n",
      "Within electronic records management systems implementations, aggregations are often used to enable inheritance of characteristics to records created or related at a lower level of aggregation. Typically in electronic records management systems, information is managed as record objects, and aggregates these objects into a set of series or files. Agencies should take into account their own business needs when determining suitable records aggregations (for example, by function, activity or transaction) within their agency. Within a business classification scheme, a records contextual characteristics are attributed through structuring them according to identifiable business processes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Record object \n",
      "\n",
      "File level \n",
      "Record object Series level Record object Record component Sub-file or volume-level aggregation (where applicable) \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Subject-based classification schemes will allow records relating to broad subject areas to be grouped together, that is, the transactions and activities that occurred under a single subject, such as a particular property or client. However, under subject-based classification, the focus is on what the item or object is about, rather than on the purpose or activity that the record was created to document. Therefore, the context of the business activity can become disassociated, making disposal actions over subject-based files more difficult as they will contain records with differing retention periods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Functional classification schemes are based on an analysis of the unique business functions and activities of an organisation, and are independent of the organisations administrative structure. This makes functional classification more flexible and stable as business units and structures are likely to change over time. This system breaks down traditional organisational information silos and enables easier retention and disposal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Business classification scheme \n",
      "A business classification scheme is a conceptual hierarchical classification tool that can facilitate the capture, titling, retrieval, maintenance and disposition of records. It defines the way in which records are grouped together (aggregated) and linked to the business context in which they were created or transmitted. For example, individual records in an organisation-wide electronic records management system may be aggregated into series with their constituent record parts and contextual metadata, or may be subsequently aggregated into files. (Note that these terms are indicative only. Different electronic records management systems employ different terminology.) Records are often aggregated at three levels of granularity according to a three-tiered functional classification scheme as follows: \n",

The introductory text to each section provides summary information regarding the records management concept and the overarching aim of the subsequent requirements. \n",
      "While they do not cover common system management and design requirements, such as interoperability, scalability and performance, it is acknowledged that such processes also support the recordkeeping functionality of the system.

      "The department has been working with Open Text Content Server since 2009 as a replacement for its existing RDIMS and iRIMS products. As part of that development, the department participated in the GCDOCS proof of concept and pilot in 2010 /11 in conjunction with PWGSC, Treasury Board and the Canadian School for Public Service. While that pilot was able to demonstrate some of the base functionality and configuration of the Open Text product, it did not provide Justice with the necessary assessment of the Records Management capabilities of the product, nor did it adequately test the product in a real life practice of law scenario. This initiative will fill in the blanks by implementing a selected subset of the Environment Canada Legal Services Units client advisory business using GCDOCS.  \n",
      "1.2 Project Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of this initiative is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Business\n",
      "Only transactional files of relatively short duration will be considered. This will preclude any files with potential precedential value or files whose active lifecycle will extend past the end of the Pathfinder phase. Only files opened during the pathfinder period will be candidates for inclusion, there will be no importing of historical information. Files will be managed from Opening phase through disposition. Functionality. Operational Platform services will be limited to core lifecycle services (file and find model) along with scanning function. \n",
      "\n",
      "Information\n",
      "Only Protected B level records and below will be included in the pathfinder. Files included in the pathfinder will need to be duplicated in iRIMS to ensure integration with iCase as no integration of iCase with GCDOCS is planned at this time.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Deployment\n",
      "The pathfinder will be deployed to a subset of lawyers within the LSU, the names of which will be provided by the LSU. Currently there are about 33 lawyers in the LSU, with an estimated 25 participating in the pathfinder. Access to GCDOCS will be through the Justice Virtual Desktop, which is currently deployed to all EC DLSU staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timeframe\n",
      "The pathfinder will end by March 31, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platform\n",
      "Only end user workstation / laptops with the VDI interface will be supported for the Pathfinder. Devices such as Blackberries are out-of-scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Project Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Project objectives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Assess the Records Management capabilities of GCDOCS for electronic records\n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS platform to support the advisory law practice line of business\n",
      "* Assess the capability of GCDOCS to support sustainable development and green enterprise through the paperless office\" concept. \n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS / VDI platform to support the DLSU business model integration with the host department\n",

      "Information is the lifeblood of the Department of Justice, and the department has long recognized its importance. The department initiated a capacity assessment of Information Management within the department early in fiscal year 2004 / 05. The result of this assessment indicated that the department could improve compliance in 11 of 12 Management of Government Information Policy (2003) requirements and developed a number of goals for the department to address the issues raised. From the assessment, IMB was asked to identify an action plan to achieve the goals identified. IMB developed a strategy to address the top three priorities which was subsequently approved by BIT.COM in November, 2004. Since that period, work has been underway in a number of areas, with the majority of progress made during the three year period from 2005/06 to 2008/09. The strategic goals and resultant initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "Resulting Initiative\n",
      "Develop a national standard for the classification and organization of information in the department\n",
      "A national file plan was developed and subsequently implemented in about half the department\n",
      "Standardize the Records Management function within the department\n",
      "The departmental records management application was standardized on version 9.1. of iRIMS and all the DLSUs were converted to a standard configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "Implement electronic records management throughout the department\n",
      "Implementation of RDIMS, at the time the government standard solution for electronic document management, was implemented to about 800 users \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the overall business goals havent changed, there have been a number of developments in policy, technology, the practice of law, and the structure of government services that have necessitated a review of the original approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the policy side, a new Record Keeping Directive (RKD) has been instituted by Treasury Board mandating information management standards in all departments by 2014. While Justice does a good job of meeting the requirements of the RKD in the physical object (paper) world, it falls well short in the electronic document space. Library and Archives Canada has also announced it will no longer accept physical objects as of 2017, making the need to move to a paperless office environment more urgent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original technology choices to support IM have proved to be outmoded and obsolete. Technology has evolved from traditional application architectures to web and cloud based ones and the department has found itself with outmoded applications that not only do not meet the needs of the department but also prevent it from upgrading its IT infrastructure due to compatibility issues with modern operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The explosion of electronic information including new formats such as twitter, instant messaging et al and its impact on the practice of law (e-discovery etc.) make the ability to effectively manage electronic records critical if we are to have advantage in the courtrooms of the 21st century and deliver the quality of service to our clients expected. \n",

      "The government has also moved recently to streamline the generic services it consumes and to reduce the deficit through cut-backs. There are three components of the government direction that impact the original IM plan:\n",

      "\n",
      "1.1 Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The IM Project will implement standard records and document management processes and products throughout the department. It will provide the foundation to define and capture all operational business records and manage them through the information lifecycle by implementing a single enterprise repository of record in the department with the goal that it will house all non-evidentiary business records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "The objectives of the IM Project are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The department will address all issues raised in the IM audit report\n",
      "* The department will meet all IM policy and legislative requirements \n",
      "* The department will realize benefits and savings from more effective and efficient IM capabilities\n",
      "* A solid IM foundation for developing, delivering and supporting legal services in the 21st century within the department will be established\n",
      " \n",
      "1.3 Departmental Initiative Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has links to every initiative having an information management impact or dimension to it, of which there are many. These have been grouped in to five categories: (1) GoC Strategic initiatives; (2) implementation of GoC Policy and Standards; (3) IMB Strategic initiatives; (4) Law Practice initiatives; and (5) other IMSD initiatives. The overall context can be pictured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "National File Plan\n",
      "Development and implementation of a national, standard taxonomy to be used to classify records. Began in 2006, approximately 50% of staff are currently using the standard. Historically, adoption of the national file plan was a pre-requisite to GCDOCS implementation for a business unit and is a much desirable prelude to implementing electronic document management. If not, converting existing file plans to the standard will have to be done in GCDOCS.\n",
      ".\n",
      "New RDA\n",
      "The new Record Disposition Authority will dictate the number and nature of RSIs that must be configured in GCDOCS RM\n",
      "\n",
      "Back Log Reduction\n",
      "Throughout the years, the department has accumulated many files that have been closed, but never disposed of. This initiative provides funding to bring in resources to process the backlogged closed files according to the RSI.\n",
      " \n",
      "Revised retention period for legal files\n",
      "The department has undertaken to reduce the retention period for legal files to 12 years from the current standard. This will have a major impact on back log reduction as it will add a multi-year complement to files in the year it is adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justipedia (KM)\n",
      "Implementation of the legal knowledge management portal in the department. Electronic records flagged as being of interest to KM must be harvested from existing electronic repositories.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCase \n",
      "iCase currently uses iRIMS for file management and there is a tight integration between the two systems. iCase also manages its own document library which has limited DM functionality at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "e-Services\n",
      "e-Services include a number of legal support IM services such as e-discovery, e-filing, holds and proof of  service\n",
      "\n",
      "Law Practice Model\n",
      "GCDOCS must be configured to support the Law Practice model such as having a single file for a case regardless of who works on it and where they are located.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services Hosting\n",
      "The government has initiated the consolidation of IT Servers and networks under a single organization, Shared Services Canada. This group will need to be part of the project team in the architecture, design and implementation of GCDOCS related infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services GCDOCS\n",
      "Treasury Board has undertaken to become the custodian of the GCDOCS product and to coordinate the establishment of GCDOCS Application Service Providers and to themselves provide a Secret level hosting service. How Justice adopts this model will impact how hosting of GCDOCS is delivered and may impose certain design restrictions on the team\n",
      "\n",
      "Deficit Reduction Action Plan\n",
      "The DRAP program will impact how the department is organized and how some services are delivered. Organizational or functional changes affect the file plan and disposition authorities. The project may also be able to assist clients in achieving DRAP goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Admin Services Review\n",
      "Admin Services review may affect structure and service delivery of admin services. This will impact how GCDOCS is configured and implemented in these areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information Strategy\n",
      "The information strategy will define what types of information will need to be managed and how it will be leveraged\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Transformation\n",
      "The business transformation initiative will change the structure and service delivery of IMB. This may impact the projects ability to recruit resources as well manage change\n",
      "1.4 Assumptions, Constraints and Risks\n",
      "1.4.1 Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Regional Implementation Teams will be used for regional implementation\n",
      "2. Multi-year funding for the project will be found within the department\n",
      "3. GCDOCS platform will be the Departmental solution for both Records Management and Document Management\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.2 Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hosting solution must be decided and constructed\n",
      "2. Project funding must be found through departmental sources\n",
      "3. Anticipated funding levels of no more than $1.8M per year will be available\n",
      "4. Solution must accommodate records up to the Secret level.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.3 Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rate of change planned in the department may prove more than can be absorbed by the end users.\n",
      "2. The upheaval and uncertainty caused by budget cuts and government structural changes creates several challenges:\n",
      "a. Uncertainty during the transition creates a distraction for resources needed to perform project tasks\n",
      "b. Organizational changes in structure and management creates a vacuum in day-to-day management especially where turnover of manager level resources and above results.\n",
      "3. The restrictions on staffing imposed by DRAP and Business Transformation makes it very difficult to fill technical positions putting the schedule at risk if qualified resources cannot be recruited.\n",
      "4. Implementation in the Department Legal Services Units (DLSUs) requires the cooperation of the host department and may impact processes and interaction between DoJ staff and clients\n",
      "5. Given the length of time forecast for implementation:\n",
      "a. upgrades to both product and infrastructure may have to be implemented over the implementation period\n",
      "b. the department may not be able to meet all the target dates for the Record Keeping Directive and potentially the Library and Archives Canada (LAC) Digital Archive standard.\n",
      "6. Given the requirement for internal funding the department may not be able to afford 100% conformance to all IM stadndards \n",

      "\n",
      "Meeting Information Management requirements as a whole is a very large undertaking. It is a challenge to maintain a picture of the overall scope of IM while at the same time dealing with the specifics in more digestible chunks.  Towards this end, at the highest level it has been divided into three sub-projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "iRIMS Standardization\n",
      "Brings all 42 iRIMS databases within the department up to a single standard configuration and consolidating some sites where practical\n",

      "\n",
      "GCDOCS DM Implementation\n",
      "Implements electronic records management throughout the department\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these sub-projects is self-contained to the point they can be executed as discrete initiatives, with the proviso they must be done in the order given. They do, however, share common components in three areas that are addressed at the project, not sub-project, level:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Management\n",
      "Each sub-project will use the same Project Office and project management framework\n",
      "\n",
      "IT Infrastructure\n",
      "Each sub-project shares IT Infrastructure in terms of products, instances, end users, and service management\n",
      "\n",
      "Program Management\n",
      "Each sub-project affects Records Operations, the National IM Business Model and IM Policy, \n",
      "\n",
      "The overall picture is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The three sub-projects have themselves been sub-divided into components as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sub-project structure is addressed in detail in section 3.0\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Project Delivery Architecture \n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery of the IM project has been decomposed into three models: Work; Methodology; and Plan. Each is in relationship to the other as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Each also has a structure, or architecture, of its own as described below. A detailed Project Structure diagram can be found in RDIMS #201377 (full size version 11X17) and as a smaller version in Appendix A.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 Work Breakdown Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Work structure describes the services and resources that need to be delivered to support IM. It defines what needs to be done. It consists of facets, components and work packages. There are five key Facet level deliverables:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Management Infrastructure\n",
      "The components and work packages required to build the Project Management infrastructure needed to manage the project over its lifespan. \n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS Operational Platform\n",
      "The components and work packages required to deliver fundamental document and records management resources to end users along with the required operational support and management structure. The GCDOCS Operational platform has both a Records Management and Document Management component. Work packages in this facet are further grouped into functional releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS Enterprise Platform\n",
      "The components and work packages required to integrate core records and document management with other enterprise applications and services such as Case Management and KM. Work packages in this facet are grouped in terms of functional releases.\n",

      "Operations & Support\n",
      "The components and work packages required to deliver IT and Records Operations support to end users for the life of IM products\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical Data Transition\n",
      "The current inventory of historical archives and repositories containing Justice paper and electronic records that must be converted to GCDOCS. Work packages in this facet can be grouped by source repository technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS is divided into two groups of services referred to as platforms: operational and enterprise. Operational services are the generic records and document services required to meet the core functional requirements for IM. It integrates GCDOCS with the generic authoring applications such as the MS Office Suite, Outlook etc. Clients who only create electronic records using authoring applications can be implemented as soon as the Operational Platform is ready. Enterprise services provide the actual integration of GCDOCS operational services with departmental applications and services that create or manage unstructured records.\n",
      "\n",
      "A detailed Work Breakdown Structure is available in RDIMS #161634.\n",
      "2.2.2 Methodology Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "The Methodology structure describes the component methodologies required to support IM. It defines how work will be accomplished.  It consists of Phases, Streams and Activities. There are four high-level supporting methodologies:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Project Lifecycle Methodology\n",
      "The various Streams and Activities required to initiate, approve, implement and eventually close out the project proper\n",

      "5.2 Project Management Office\n",
      "\n",
      "A key aspect of the project management framework is establishing a Project Management Office capable of supporting the broad range of activities and deliverables across the project while ensuring all day-to-day operational and corporate staff and reporting requirements are met. To do this, the PMO will provide the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "General Administration\n",
      "The PMO will support sound management for the project through the provisions of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Financial administration by maintaining the project books showing up-to-date budget, forecast and expenditure management figures\n",
      "2. Support staffing initiatives in the project and maintaining an up-to-date org  chart\n",
      "3. Ensuring all corporate and internal reporting requirements are met on time\n",
      "4. Tracking client satisfaction and ensuring follow-up surveys are completed as per plan\n",
      "5. Acting as a coordinator for dispatching IM related Help Desk tickets\n",
      "Project Administration\n",
      "The PMO will provide the day-to-day administration functions to implement and support the management frameworks noted in 5.1 above and supporting functions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Training Office\n",
      "Given the criticality of the training function in GCDOCS and the extent of the work involved to define and deliver training to 6,000 people, a separate Training Office for GCDOCS should be established. This office will be responsible for the following deliverables:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define and develop the entire training curriculum for end users, whether Records Operations, Clients or support staff\n",
      "2. Define and develop the training infrastructure required to deliver the curriculum\n",
      "Schedule and deliver training in coordination with the implementation plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Resource Management\n",
      "Resource Management functions include Accommodation, project related training, contract administration and the recording, inventory and disposal of all project assets.\n",

      "\n",
      "5.3 Project Planning \n",
      "\n",
      "To date, committed multi-year funding has not been available to the project. To accommodate this, the project will work on a regime of fiscal year plans that will be a subset of the master plan. This will require that each year, the project submit a funding proposal for work to be accomplished in the relevant year. It is anticipated the project will take at least 5 years to complete given historic funding levels. The work plans have laid out the entire scope of all that needs to be done to implement GCDOCS department-wide. The work plans themselves have been set up to allow filtering of tasks based on a number of criteria. As part of the operational planning process at the start of each fiscal year, the Project Manager will prioritize the remaining tasks in the work plan based on budget expectations and select a subset of activities to form the funding submission for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3.1 Managing Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the size of the IM project in general, the approach will be to define a series of sub-projects, with a general duration of no more than two years. Charters will be developed at the sub-project level. This will align more closely with the realities of the department. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sub-projects can run concurrently if there are sufficient resources available to do so. Unless multi-year funding is obtained, each sub-project will prepare an annual funding submission and plan as part of the corporate governance process. As noted, there are currently three generic sub-projects defined: iRIMS Standardization, GCDOCS RM Implementation and GCDOCS DM Implementation. Given the size and effort required for GCDOCS DM implementation, it may be split into further sub-projects, potentially on a regional basis (i.e. treat DM implementation in each region as a sub-project). Components of each can also be bundled as a sub-project.\n",
      "5.4 Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance for the project can be pictured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance occurs on two planes: (1) Internal governance and; (2) External. \n",
      "5.4.1 Internal Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal governance provides the framework for direction and decision within the department proper. It is accomplished through four areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The IMB Executive provides day-to-day monitoring and operational direction to the project. It consists of the CIO, IMB Executive, and the Project Sponsor.\n",
      "2. The Steering Committee is composed of representative stakeholders in the client and partner realms. Membership in the client area changes as implementation proceeds.\n",
      "3. IM / IT Governance covers the various committees established within the department to monitor and define IT standards and practices. It provides direction in the areas of technology choices.\n",
      "4. Corporate governance makes investment decisions and sets departmental priorities.  \n",
      "5.4.2 External Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "External governance provides the framework for direction and decision to align departmental initiatives with the government as a whole. There are two main interfaces:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Treasury Board of Canada has several broad governance facets:\n",
      "a. It defines IT and IM policy and standards for the government as a whole. The project will ensure that IM Policy and directives requirements are incorporated into the GCDOCS solution.\n",
      "b. It defines the project management framework for the government as a whole. The project will adopt the framework elements defined by TB.\n",
      "c. It is the approval / monitoring body for major departmental initiatives. Project approval is obtained through the departmental Investment Plan, PCRA and OPMCA submission to Treasury Board. \n",
      "2. Shared Services Canada hosts all network and servers for the government as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interface to external governance is done through the appropriate internal governance mechanism. The corporate governance model manages the interface to Treasury Board and the Branch IM / IT Governance model manages the interface to Shared Services Canada,\n",
      "6 Project Organization\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 Project Team\n",
      "\n",
      "A key strategy for the project is to create virtual project team whereby a project team is set up in each region to support the HQ project team. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.1 Team Structure\n",

      "\n",
      "6.1.2 Regional Team Integration \n",
      "\n",
      "An IM project team will be established in each region to manage all the local activities required to implement IM standards in the region. The regional team will report directly to the regional IM / IT Director but also have a line reporting relationship to the HQ Team lead for their area of focus (business or IT). The IM / IT Director will work with the project manager to develop funding submissions and work plans for the year as well as provide regular status reports and financial updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regional teams will use the project defined management and project administration frameworks and file all records to the projects GCDOCS repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall project team will be subdivided into business, training and technical communities to focus on specific deliverables, problems, and issues affecting each. Each community will hold regular virtual meetings to review progress and address bottlenecks. All resources will be tasked with specific deliverables\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Roles and Responsibilities\n",
      "\n",
      "The Project Team has been organized along functional responsibility into six teams. In addition there are direct dependencies to the Policy & Projects and Records Operations sections of IMSD to partner in the development of the Policy and Records Operations components of IM as well as to the regional IM / IT teams who will be responsible to implement IM in the regional offices. There is a Team Charter for each team that defines the roles and responsibilities each team has. Also, each component of the Work Breakdown Structure (RIDMS #26669) is colour coded as to which team has primary responsibility for delivery. The details can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Office\n",
      "Provides admin support to the project team (meeting management, finance etc.), and manages communications for the project. It also provides Project Management support to the regions in terms of PM infrastructure. The Project Manager is considered part of the Project Office for budgetary purposes. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical Team\n",
      "Provides IT infrastructure and application management for other five teams. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Team\n",

      " \n",
      "Training Office\n",
      "Develops all training materials, provides training and coaching to end users in all IM disciplines and products as well as trains regional Trainers. Refer to Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Transition Team\n",
      "Develops conversion strategies and utilities for transferring electronic records from current systems to the new IM platform. Also develops strategies and frameworks to operate parallel systems for the implementation period. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "IMSD\n",
      "Responsible for the development of IM Policy and IM Operations procedures. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Regions\n",
      "Provides IM Implementation support at the regional level. Includes a subset of the functions of the Technical Team, DM Business Team, RM Business Team and file plan development. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 Partners\n",
      "\n",
      "The Project Team consists of both business and technical resources in HQ and in each region.\n",
      "The project Manager reports to the Director of IMSD who is also the business client. The Project Manager also has a delivery partnership with the regional IM / IT Directors for the coordination of regional work as well as budgeting and scheduling\n",

      "7.1.3 Resource Acquisition\n",
      "\n",
      "Being that this project was borne out of the previous RDIMS Implementation project; the HQ project team was largely in place at project initiation. As a general strategy, the Team Lead for each team is recruited first who is then responsible for recruiting / staffing his / her team.  For HQ, indeterminate staff will be recruited from existing IMB resources where they currently exist. Vacancies will be staffed using a variety of competitive process, transfers and secondments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contract resources will be acquired using a number of different approaches, depending on location and need. Where there are long-term generic continuing needs such as for business analysts, trainers, and technical analysts, TBIPS will be used for HQ needs. A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation will be provided to each region who will conduct their own contracting process using local firms. For specific one time activities related to the Project Office or speciality work, contracting vehicles appropriate to the budget and requirements will be selected as the need arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some components of the work plan may be contracted out on a turnkey solutions basis depending on budget and availability of internal expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Server and network infrastructure will be contracted for from Shared Services Canada. Final costs for this service are yet to be determined. License costs for GCDOCS will depend on the final module configuration. Licenses for the standard GCDOCS configuration is $88.00 per user, with Justice currently having about 5,800 employees / consultants. \n",
      "\n",
      "Procurement for contract resources is done prior to the phase in which they are needed. Some resources will only be required for a specific phase, whereas some may be required throughout all phases. Hardware and software will be acquired in two stages: once the technical architecture is signed off, the foundational components required to implement the system will be procured and installed at the end of the development phase. Where components are required as the implementation scales up, they will be installed as needed during the Implementation phase.\n",
      "7.1.4 Project Staff Training\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff training will be required in a number of areas and can be seen as occurring in three broad categories:\n",

Ideally, each sub-project should have unique resources assigned to it with a team leader / champion over each.

There will be an HQ Business Analysts assigned to each site to work with the site coordinator to determine the correct mappings as well as to keep the initiative moving forward. The methodology for this process is found in RDIMS #231012\n",

      "GCDOCS RM Implementation can be seen as two thrusts: Physical Object Management and Electronic Records Management. All sites today are managing physical objects (paper) through iRIMS, and implementation of GCDOCS RM simply means transferring the function to GCDOCS. Only HQ and ORO are doing electronic records management today, for all other sites it will be a new service. Implementation will start with a pathfinder site, currently ARO, and after a short evaluation period (1 month), implementation will proceed to other regions where iRIMS standardization has been completed. Implementation can proceed in parallel. It is expected as well that the first sites to be implemented (ARO & PRO) will provide support as needed to other regions in their own implementations. The target model is to create a virtual records management team nation-wide capable of supporting any client.\n",

      "8.4 GCDOCS DM Development \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the challenges facing the department in implementing IM is that there has been a great deal of independence in defining business models and IM practices from organization to organization in the past. This is especially true region to region. This lack of a standard business model does not portend well for the project for several reasons: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. There are more than 350 Business units within the department. It is simply not cost-effective nor affordable to allow each unit to define a custom information architecture (i.e. file plan / folder structure) from scratch for the full range of their operations\n",

      "2. Portfolio executives have increasing requirements for accessing and querying the records under their control in a consistent manner and to realize cost savings and reduction that streamlining and reuse through consistent, repeatable procedures and methods bring\n",

      "8.4.1 Corporate Superstructures\n",

      "To address this, the project strategy will be to undertake to develop corporate level information architectures that will define how information is to be organized and disposed of. These architectures are referred to as superstructures since they are represented by a folder structure within GCDOCS that will be common to all groups within the area of discipline covered. Where possible the superstructure will also come per-configured with a file plan. Superstructure can be developed by function, organization or community of practice. The idea is to achieve an 80% coverage rule i.e. the superstructure meets 80% of any particular business units needs with the remaining 20% to be addressed as custom tailoring at the time of implementation. This has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required to implement electronic document management. Currently, the following superstructures have been defined:\n",

      "5.1\tConfiguration\n",
      "BSAS created a SP2010 lab environment for the Gap Analysis.  It was installed according to the standard installation instructions that come with SP2010.  The BA Team asked that all functionality be enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "As testing progressed, additional support was sought from BSAS and eventually Microsoft.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For some of the FRs, the challenge was not the ability of SP2010 to do the function, it was the technical setup of the lab environment.  These were usually simple to correct once identified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of particular note, this evaluation is limited to what is available in the SP2010 license itself.  SP2010 must be able to meet the requirement without Addons or customization.  This is true even for the requirements worded alone or in conjunction with other systems.  The BA Team felt that no useful evaluation would have been possible if an indefinite list of possible Addons were included.  All FRs would have passed because somewhere out there someone probably has a system or could create one that could cause SP2010 to meet the requirement.  By limiting the evaluation to what is available with the purchase of an SP2010 license, the knowledge of what the SP2010 offering can provide is known and reported on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are a few FRs where the functionality required is more about the EDRMS being able to integrate than it is about functionality being delivered by an Addon.  These have been passed and an indication given that they were not fully tested. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Addon information has been included in the Group Notes whenever Microsoft named a specific Addon that could provide the additional functionality.  The Addons have not been tested.\n",

      "\n",
      "5.2\tProcess\n",
      "SP2010 was evaluated against the JUS IM System Requirements 2011 through testing done by the BA Team.  The BA Team evaluated the requirements to the best of their ability and, where necessary, sought additional information from Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yes/No Rating indicates whether the functional or metadata requirement has been met at all by SP2010.  The Rating Scale (A+ to Fails) gives a subjective indicator of how well SP2010 meets the requirement.  The entire evaluation took place over several weeks.  Having all members of the BA Team available at all times was not possible but there were always at least two people on the BA Team involved in the evaluation of every requirement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where JUS would like to see improvement in SP2010 related to the requirement, this has been flagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BA Team included Robert Sguin, Derek Auger, Bryan Dewar, Josette Gaudreault, Krysta, St.Amand, and Angelique Everitt.  \n",

      "iCase representatives were consulted as necessary during the evaluation of iCase metadata and functional requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft was given the opportunity to review the failing items before the report was finalized. Microsoft attended several meetings and provided input as to how FRs could be met with SP2010.  The input received from them has been included.  They were unable to provide the resources to review and feedback on the GCRMFRs but they did review all other FRs.\n",

      "5.3\tAppendix C  Other Requirements\n",
      "The Other Requirements in Appendix C are not the typical requirements one finds in gap analyses.  These are requirements coming out of information management policies and directives.  They are usually more like statements of responsibility and no system can be evaluated against them.  A few are system-related and they have been identified in Appendix C.  The evaluation of most of these Other Requirements did not lend itself to the same Yes/No rating that worked for the Functional and Metadata Requirements so an explanation of how JUS is complying with the requirement has been provided by the various areas in IMSD responsible for these requirements.  The 7 system-related ones are reported on in 4.7 above.\n",

      "6.0 \tChallenges Encountered \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1\t Environment for the Gap Analysis\n",
      "It was several months of negotiating with TSD before an environment was made available for the IM Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 SP2010 Knowledge\n",
      "There was no training for the BA Team prior to starting the Gap Analysis.  Through the use of manuals and the vast Internet resources available on the subject of SharePoint, the BA Team was able to get about 70% of the FRs tested to their satisfaction.  For the remaining 30%, it was difficult to know if the system could not meet the requirement or the inability to find a way to meet the requirement was due to the lack of expertise or administrative privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, Microsofts review of the FRs was essential to the completion of the Gap Analysis.  There feedback was reviewed and the relevant FRs tested then the Gap Analysis was modified as appropriate.  \n",

      "Working with the ISO Standards was often quite difficult.  Terminology was the biggest problem.  The language used in 16175-2 is especially confusing when it comes to aggregations.  All of the following terms are used: aggregations, non-digital aggregations, digital aggregations, hybrid aggregations, hybrid non-digital aggregations, and hybrid digital aggregations.  Where the BAs involved in the Gap Analysis could agree on the likely meaning, the FR was evaluated.  For several of the FRs the meaning was so well hidden that the FR remains unevaluated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other challenge with the ISO Standards is the relationship amongst systems assumed by the Standards.  For these ISO Standards, the 16175-2 Module deals with finalized records in an ERMS and 16175-3 deals with in-process records in the DMS.  The assumption is that records are passed to the ERMS once finalized or in order to be finalized.  This does not match the physical reality of SP2010 which can lifecycle the records in the DMS.  This disconnect between the model assumed by the Standards and the reality of the solution being evaluated does make the evaluation process a bit muddier than it could be.  \n",

      "* There are some reports available out of the box but there is no report designing functionality built into SP2010.  For FRs that would require the development of a new report, the FRs have failed.  There is one report that is available out-of-the-box that does not work in the Gap environment.  This appears to be a shortfall of the environment, not of SP2010.  For FRs that would likely be satisfied by this report, they have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested; \n",
      "* There is some Thesaurus-related functionality that did not work in the Gap environment but should have.  FRs having to do with Thesaurus functionality have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* IM Project resources would need to develop expertise and possess the necessary tools needed to test the FRs having to do with recovering deleted items using specialist data recovery tools.  These FRs have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* The FRs having to do with Exports where the export of an entire Document Library would satisfy the FR have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* Many of the FRs dealt with system notifications being generated when an error of some sort happened but these are impossible to test because forcing the system to, for instance, partially save a document is not possible.  These FRs have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* Several FRs included the following wording, creating or receiving digital records generated by electronic messaging systems.  In order to fully test these FRs, JUS would need to allow POP mail services but this was not possible for Gap.  Most of these FRs have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* Several FRs dealt with backup and recovery processes.  Some backup and recovery was tested but not every single FR.  These have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* Many of the FRs dealt with workflow.  Some but not all were tested.  Where it is functionality that can be achieved with the workflow delivered as part of the SP2010 license, these have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested;\n",
      "* Several FRs dealt with the capture of events into the Audit of an object.  Microsoft confirmed what is tracked in Audit but in order to see it, a report must be run.  For the objects in the system where no out-of-the-box report existed that could show the Audit information, these FRs have been passed and an indicator given that they have not been fully tested; and\n",

      "1 INTRODUCTION \n",
      "Good management of records and information is fundamental to a well-functioning organisation since it supports business activity and provides a basis for efficient service delivery. It also provides the mechanism whereby both the private and public sectors can account for their decisions and actions. Records provide evidence for the public to confirm or claim their public rights and entitlements, as well as providing individuals with evidence to justify government decisions and a mechanism whereby they can have trust in private enterprise. Moreover, good records management is simply good business practice. \n",
      "Records management systems facilitate: \n",
      "\n",
      " efficiency, by making information readily available when needed for decision-making and operational activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " sound use of financial resources, by allowing timely disposal of non-current records; \n",
      "\n",
      " accountability, by enabling the creation of a complete and authoritative record of official activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " compliance, by demonstrating that legal requirements have been met; and \n",
      "\n",
      " risk mitigation, by managing the risks associated with illegal loss or destruction of records, and from inappropriate or unauthorised access to records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Scope \n",
      "A fundamental underlying principle is the distinction between business information systems (business systems) and electronic records management systems. Business systems contain data that is commonly subject to constant updates (dynamic), able to be transformed (manipulable) and only contain current data (non-redundant). By contrast, electronic records management systems contain data that is not dynamically linked to business activity (fixed), unable to be altered (inviolable), and may be non-current (redundant). Therefore business systems are beyond the scope of this Module (see Module 3: Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Records in Business Systems). The records within an electronic records management system are, however, still dynamic in the sense that they can be (re)used in new business activity/contexts, so new metadata will be added through the ongoing use of the record content. It is more appropriate to speak about a framework for the systematic and structured management of records; records management systems link records to business activities, retain records of past actions, and fix the content and structure of records over time. \n",
      "The scope of this Module is limited to products that are usually termed electronic records management systems. It does not seek to set requirements for records still in use within business systems. Digital objects created by email, word processing, spreadsheet and imaging applications (such as text documents, and still and moving images), where they are identified to be of business value, should be managed within electronic records management systems that meet the functional requirements in this Module. [1]Records managed by an electronic records management system may be stored on a variety of different media formats, and may be managed in hybrid record aggregations that include both electronic and non-electronic elements. \n",
      "This Module does not attempt to include requirements that are not specific to, or necessary for, records management, for example, general system management and design requirements. Nor does it include requirements common to all software applications, such as the performance, scalability and usability of the application. [2]Given the target audience of this document, it also assumes a level of knowledge about developing design specifications, procurement and evaluation processes, and therefore these issues are not covered in this Module. Although not included in this Modules requirements, the importance of non-records management functional requirements for records management systems is recognised through their inclusion in the high-level model outlined in Section 2.3: Overview of functional requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specifications for the long-term preservation of electronic records are also beyond the scope of this Module as this issue should be addressed separately by a dedicated strategy for digital preservation or electronic archiving. These electronic archiving considerations transcend the life of systems and are system independent; they need to be assessed in a specific longer-term strategic framework. However, recognition of the need to maintain records for as long as they are required must be addressed, and potential migration or format obsolescence issues should also be considered. Specific policies and procedures for these should be developed to support the longevity of records for permanent or long-term retention. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Purpose \n",
      "This Module articulates a set of functional requirements for electronic records management systems. These requirements apply to records irrespective of the media in which they were created and stored. They are intended to: \n",
      "\n",
      " explain processes and requirements for identifying and managing records in electronic records management systems; \n",
      "\n",
      " develop requirements for records management functionality to be included in a design specification when building, upgrading or purchasing electronic records management systems software; \n",
      "\n",
      " inform records management functional requirements in the selection of commercially available electronic records management systems; and \n",
      "\n",
      " review the records management functionality or assess compliance of existing electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Module has been developed as part of an International Council on Archives project designed to: \n",
      "\n",
      " assist organisations to improve electronic records management practices; \n",
      "\n",
      " reduce the duplication of effort and associated costs in identifying a minimum level of records management functionality for electronic records management systems; and \n",
      " establish greater standardisation of records management requirements for software vendors across different jurisdictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Audience \n",
      "The primary audience for this document is staff responsible for designing, reviewing and/or implementing electronic records management systems in organisations  whether those systems are commercial off-the-shelf electronic records management software applications, or custom-built applications. This Module primarily addresses the requirements of organisational records managers or system procurement project leaders, but will be relevant for jurisdictional standard-setters and the wider records management community. Another key audience is software vendors and developers who market and/or develop electronic records management system products. This Module is intended to inform their decision-making when designing records management functionality within electronic records management products. \n",
      "Given the primary target audience for this document, the authors have tried to minimise the use of specific records management terminology. Where the use of such terminology is necessary, definitions can be found in the Glossary at Appendix A. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Related standards \n",
      "Under its Electronic Records and Automation Priority Area, the International Council on Archives has developed a suite of guidelines and functional requirements as part of the Principles and Functional Requirements for Records in Electronic Office Environments project: \n",
      "\n",
      " Module 1: Overview and Statement of Principles; \n",
      "\n",
      " Module 2: Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Records in Electronic Office Environments; and \n",

      "Readers of this document should also take note of any relevant jurisdiction-specific standards and specifications. \n",
      "Note: this module is not intended to over-ride any local or jurisdiction-specific legislation standards or requirements. \n",

      "MoReq2. \n",
      "\n",
      "[4]1.5 Terminology \n",
      "Many of the terms used in this document have differing definitions across disciplines. For example, the term archive may mean a storage of little-used data in a database to an IT audience, whereas it means the retention of fixed appraised information no longer retained for current business use within the records management discipline. It is therefore important that this document is read in conjunction with the Glossary at Appendix A. A number of the central concepts used in this document are also outlined below, to avoid misinterpretation: \n",
      "\n",
      " Records  information created, received and maintained as evidence and information by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.1 They provide evidence of business transactions and can exist in any format.   \n",
      "1 International Standard on Records Management, ISO 15489. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Records management  the control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposal of records in accordance with professional and international standards of practice. Records management is distinct from document management, which is typically concerned with the provision of access, collaborative working and version control of documents, rather than the management of authenticity, reliability, integrity and useability over time. \n",
      "\n",
      " Electronic records management systems (commonly referred to as EDRMS or ERMS)  systems specifically designed to manage the maintenance and disposition of records. They maintain the content, context, structure and links between records to enable their accessibility and support their value as evidence. Electronic records management systems are distinguished from business systems, for the purpose of this document, because their primary function is the management of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Business systems  automated systems that create or manage data about an organisations activities (for the purpose of this document). They include applications whose primary purpose is to facilitate transactions between an organisational unit and its customers, for example, an e-commerce system, client-relationship management system, purpose-built or customised database, and finance or human resources systems. Business systems typically contain dynamic data that is commonly subject to constant updates (timely), able to be transformed (manipulable) and holds current data (non-redundant). For the purpose of this document, business systems exclude electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      " System  use of the term system in this document refers to a computer or IT system. This is in contrast to the records management understanding of the term, which encompasses the broader aspects of people, policies, procedures and practices. While the focus of this Module is primarily electronic records management systems software, organisations will need to pay attention to wider aspects of records management frameworks, policies and tools to ensure records can be appropriately managed. For example, fundamental records management tools, such as disposition authorities and information security classifications, must be in place and operate within an established records management culture within the organisation. A system may comprise more than one application and include plug-ins. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata  an inextricable part of records management, serving a variety of functions and purposes. In a records management context, metadata is defined as data describing the context, content and structure of records and their management through time (ISO 15489  1: 2001, 3.12). As such, metadata is structured or semi-structured information that enables the creation, registration, classification, access, preservation and disposition of records through time and within and across domains. Records management metadata can be used to identify, authenticate and contextualise records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them, and the policies that govern them. Initially, metadata defines the record at its point of capture, fixing the record into its business context and establishing management control over it. During the existence of records or their aggregates, new layers of metadata will be added because of new roles in other business or usage contexts. This means that metadata continues to accrue information relating to the context of the records management and the business processes in which the records are used, and to structural changes to the record or its appearance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata can be sourced or re-used by multiple systems and for multiple purposes. Metadata applied to records during their active life may also continue to apply when the records cease to be required for current business purposes but are retained for ongoing research or other values. The purpose of records management metadata is to ensure authenticity, reliability, usability and integrity over time, and to enable the management and understanding of information objects, whether these are physical, analogue or electronic. However, metadata also needs to be managed as a record or as a component of a record. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records management has always involved the management of metadata. However, the electronic environment requires a different expression of traditional requirements and different mechanisms for identifying, capturing, attributing and using metadata. In the electronic environment, authoritative records are those accompanied by metadata defining their critical characteristics. These characteristics must be explicitly documented rather than being implicit, as in some paper-based processes. \n",

      "2.1 What are records and why are they important? \n",
      "Records are a valuable business asset. One of the key ways organisations are held accountable for their actions is through evidence of business transactions in the form of records. Records are information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information, by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.2 They must be retained for a period of time that is in line with an authorised retention schedule or disposition authority, sometimes referred to as a disposition. \n",
      "A record is not just a collection of data, but is the consequence or product of an event and therefore linked to business activities. A distinguishing feature of records is that their content must exist in a fixed form, that is, be a fixed representation of the business transaction. Managing records in business systems, which contain data that is frequently updated and dynamic, is particularly challenging and may provide a rationale for implementing a separate electronic records management system. Records comprise not only content but also information about the context and structure of the record. Records management metadata identifies, authenticates and contextualises records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them and the policies that govern them.3 It allows records to be located, rendered and understood in a meaningful way. ISO/TS 23081  2 provides a generic statement of records management metadata elements. Organisations may also have jurisdiction-specific elements sets to which they must adhere. \n",
      "An appropriately managed record will provide a basis for: \n",
      "\n",
      " transparent, informed and quality decision-making and planning; \n",
      "\n",
      " an information resource that can be used to demonstrate and account for organisational activities; and \n",
      "\n",
      " consistency, continuity and efficiency in administration and management. \n",
      "\n",
      "The International Standard on Records Management, ISO 15489, provides best-practice guidance on how records should be managed to ensure they are authentic, reliable, complete, unaltered and usable. Organisations that do not employ an electronic records management system may risk loss of key evidence of their business activities, thereby resulting in a lack of corporate memory, inefficiency and an inability to meet accountability and legislative requirements. The risks of not implementing an electronic records management system are: \n",
      "\n",
      " failure to meet legislative and regulatory requirements;\n",
      "\n",
      " embarrassment to your chief executive, the government and/or private individuals, especially if inability to manage information competently is highlighted in the media; \n",
      "\n",
      " poor strategic planning and poor decisions based on inaccurate information; \n",
      "\n",
      " business critical information not accessible for the conduct of business, dispute resolution, legal challenge or evidential purposes; \n",
      "\n",
      " loss of credibility, lowered public confidence, or financial or legislative penalties through inability to produce records or provide evidence of business activity when required in a timely manner; \n",

      "\n",
      " protection of the interests of the organisation and the rights of employees, clients, and present and future stakeholders; \n",
      "\n",
      " improved security of business records and robust management of commercial-in-confidence, personally sensitive or confidential information; \n",
      "\n",
      " the ability to deliver services in an efficient and consistent manner; \n",
      "\n",
      " ability to support current and future research and development activities; \n",

      "Authoritative and credible recordkeeping is an essential component of good governance and for underpinning reliable and consistent business practice and service delivery. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Characteristics of electronic records and electronic records management systems \n",
      "Once records have been created, they must be managed and maintained for as long as required to ensure they have the following characteristics:4\n",
      "\n",
      " Authenticity  the record can be proven to be what it purports to be, to have been created or sent by the person that created or sent it, and to have been created or sent at the time it is purported to have occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      " Reliability  the record can be trusted as a full and accurate representation of the transaction(s) to which they attest, and can be depended on in the course of subsequent transactions. \n",
      "\n",
      " Integrity  the record is complete and unaltered, and protected against unauthorised alteration. This characteristic is also referred to as inviolability. \n",
      "\n",
      " Usability  the record can be located, retrieved, preserved and interpreted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, electronic records management systems have the following attributes that seek to ensure these characteristics are maintained: \n",
      "\n",
      " Creating records in context  electronic records management systems enable organisations to capture evidence of their business activity. This involves identifying a set of electronic information to serve as the evidential record comprising both content and context. So, in order for information to have the capability of functioning as a record, it is necessary to augment that content information with additional data (that is, metadata) that places it in the context of the business operations and computing environment in which it was created. \n",
      "\n",
      " Managing and maintaining records  electronic records have to be actively managed as evidence of business activity, and to maintain their authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability. Maintenance of this evidence, as records, is necessary for operational viability and accountability of the organisation. \n",
      "\n",
      " Maintaining records for as long as they are required  records must be retained for a period of time that is in accordance with authorised legislative and jurisdictional requirements. Decisions about how long records must be retained are defined in disposition/disposal policies and rules. There will be some records that must be retained permanently while others will be required to be retained for varying periods or have a maximum retention period (for example, for privacy or data-protection legislative purposes). \n",
      "\n",
      "Records have to be able to be disposed of in a managed, systematic and auditable way. A hallmark of appropriate records management is the retention and appropriate disposition of records according to specified rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "Systems need to be able to delete records in a systematic, auditable and accountable way in line with operational and juridical requirements. Organisations will need to meet the policies and procedures of their local jurisdictional authority for identifying, retaining and disposing of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata can be configured  to be meaningful as evidence of a business process, records must be linked to the context of their creation and use. To do this, the record must be associated with metadata about the business context in a classification structure. In addition to this classification metadata, other metadata that should be captured at the point of creation includes: \n",
      " identifier; \n",
      " date of creation; \n",
      " creator/author/person responsible; and \n",
      " the business being conducted. \n",
      "Much of this information can be automatically generated. In this Module, integration of metadata for managing records is addressed at a relatively high level. Rather than specifically detailing every metadata element required, the functional requirements set instead provides broad references to the need to have functionality that is capable of creating, capturing and maintaining adequate metadata elements. It is expected that each organisation will capture records management metadata in line with an identified records management metadata standard, in accordance with organisational and/or jurisdictional requirements, and/or be consistent with ISO 23081  1: 2006, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 1  Principles; and ISO/TS 23081  2: 2007, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 2  Conceptual and Implementation Issues. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records can be reassigned or reclassified, closed and if required, duplicated and extracted  the identification of needs for records should establish at what point in the process a record should be created. Any further processes that happen to the record after this point must result in the creation of a new record or the recorded augmentation/versioning of the existing record, rather than alteration to it. This means that content and metadata that need to be kept to record previous decisions or processes cannot be overwritten, but that new content or metadata can be added. \n",
      "It is important to ensure that the system is not locked down to such an extent that simple mistakes (such as mistyping a name) cannot be corrected  although permission for changes may be restricted to a system administrator or prevented by the system in exceptional circumstances, such as pending legal action. \n",
      "\n",
      " Reports can be undertaken  on records and the management thereof. \n",
      "\n",
      " Security processes can be put in place  normal systems controls over access and security support the maintenance of authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability, and therefore should be appropriately documented. \n",
      "\n",
      "A risk assessment can inform business decisions as to how rigorous the controls need to be. For example, in a high-risk environment, it may be necessary to prove exactly what happened, when and by whom. This links to systems permissions and audit logging, to prove that approved actions are undertaken by authorised users. User requirements should be assigned at appropriate levels of access by an administrator. \n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1: System levels of access \n",
      "User \n",
      "Any person with permission to access the electronic records management system. That is, anyone who creates, receives, reviews and/or uses records stored in the system. This is the standard level of access that most employees of an organisation will possess. \n",
      "Authorised user \n",
      "A user with special access permissions that allow additional access to, and/or control over, records contained in the electronic records management system. Authorised users may in some instances be assigned permissions to undertake tasks similar to those of the system administrator, such as the ability to close and re-open records, create extracts of records and edit record metadata. The powers assigned to authorised users will vary depending on the business needs of the organisation and the level of responsibility allotted to the authorised user. \n",
      "Records administrator (or records manager) \n",
      "A system administrator, usually the records manager, with designated responsibility for configuring, monitoring and managing the electronic records management system content and its use. \n",
      "System administrator (IT) \n",
      "A person with responsibility for assigning and removing the permissions allocated to users and authorised users. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 Supporting import, export and interoperability \n",
      "The ability to import and export records, and interoperability with other systems, is frequently required functionality. Records may need to be exported to other organisations in the event of mergers or government re-organisational changes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many records may need to be retained for longer than the lifespan of the software system itself, and therefore there is a need to be able to export records when transitioning to a new electronic records management system. There may also be a need to import records from business systems, particularly in collaborative business environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "For ease of import and export, use of open formats and industry standards will increase levels of interoperability and reduce the cost and difficulty of any import/export process. \n",
      "\n",
      "This functionality must be addressed at the planning stages as part of the business requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.2 Authentication, encryption and technological protection measures \n",
      "These issues have an impact on the reliability of records issue. Electronic records management systems must allow records to be effectively managed when they have been subject to technological protection measures, electronic signatures and electronic watermarks (digital rights management). They should give particular consideration to the ongoing maintenance of records that have been subject to encryption and digital signatures. While encryption and digital signatures have a valuable role to play in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of records in transmission, they also present risks to the ongoing useability of the record as decryption keys and public keys for digital signatures may expire while the record is still required. For this reason, storing records in encrypted form is not recommended. Metadata can record the encryption and decryption processes and attest to the successful decryption of records. \n",
      "\n",
      "If digital signatures are used as a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of records, key management must be considered. Information about the digital signature and its validation should be recorded within the metadata. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Overview of functional requirements \n",
      "This section identifies and briefly describes the functional requirements using a high-level model that clusters the requirements to highlight their inter-relationships (Figure 1).

      "\n",
      "2.3.1 Create \n",
      "Capture \n",
      "Electronic records management systems uniquely capture, classify and identify records to ensure that their content, structure and context of creation are fixed in time and space. These records management processes facilitate the making of complete, authentic and usable records. There should be functionality to create a new record by reusing the content, structure and context of records once captured. While version/document control is beyond the scope of this Module it may also provide some of this functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records aggregations \n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records are accumulations of related electronic record entities that, when combined, may exist at a level above that of a singular electronic record object, for example, a file. Aggregations represent relationships that exist between related electronic records and the system or environment in which they were created, and are recorded in their metadata links and/or other associations. These aggregations are typically controlled within a classification scheme in an electronic records management system. \n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic records management systems may contain aggregations of records, records that are not aggregated, or both. Records aggregations structure related electronic records and support their management and usability. They may be at more than one level, and may have multiple relationships within separate aggregations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records may reflect relationships such as shared characteristics or attributes, or the existence of sequential relationships between related electronic records. The nature of the relationship between the electronic records of a particular aggregation will vary depending on factors such as their purpose and structure, and the content and format of the records themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an aggregation of electronic records may collectively constitute a narrative of events (that is, a series of connected business transactions), in which the records may have a sequential relationship. Any such sequential relationship between electronic records can be determined through the metadata elements associated with the records, such as titles, dates, author, container number (where applicable), and other such attributes. Where these relationships exist between records imported or extracted from external business systems, the electronic records management system should be capable of identifying, capturing, documenting and preserving them. \n",
      "These aggregations may be formal, structured relationships (for example, digital files containing related digital documents), or may exist as less formalised, tightly bound metadata relationships recognised as establishing links between related records within an aggregation. \n",
      "The aggregations must be fixed and maintained over time. Any change to an aggregation must be logged with an explanation. Aggregation for the management of records purposes should not be confused with, or replaced by, the generation of multiple, different aggregations in response to search requests or report queries. \n",
      "Figure 2: Aggregation of records \n",
      "Identification (registration) \n",
      "To verify their existence within the system, every record and associated aggregation must have a unique identifier persistently linked to it. This allows the user to locate records and helps them to distinguish between versions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Classification \n",
      "Within electronic records management systems implementations, aggregations are often used to enable inheritance of characteristics to records created or related at a lower level of aggregation. Typically in electronic records management systems, information is managed as record objects, and aggregates these objects into a set of series or files. Agencies should take into account their own business needs when determining suitable records aggregations (for example, by function, activity or transaction) within their agency. Within a business classification scheme, a records contextual characteristics are attributed through structuring them according to identifiable business processes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Record object \n",
      "\n",
      "File level \n",
      "Record object Series level Record object Record component Sub-file or volume-level aggregation (where applicable) \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Subject-based classification schemes will allow records relating to broad subject areas to be grouped together, that is, the transactions and activities that occurred under a single subject, such as a particular property or client. However, under subject-based classification, the focus is on what the item or object is about, rather than on the purpose or activity that the record was created to document. Therefore, the context of the business activity can become disassociated, making disposal actions over subject-based files more difficult as they will contain records with differing retention periods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Functional classification schemes are based on an analysis of the unique business functions and activities of an organisation, and are independent of the organisations administrative structure. This makes functional classification more flexible and stable as business units and structures are likely to change over time. This system breaks down traditional organisational information silos and enables easier retention and disposal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Business classification scheme \n",
      "A business classification scheme is a conceptual hierarchical classification tool that can facilitate the capture, titling, retrieval, maintenance and disposition of records. It defines the way in which records are grouped together (aggregated) and linked to the business context in which they were created or transmitted. For example, individual records in an organisation-wide electronic records management system may be aggregated into series with their constituent record parts and contextual metadata, or may be subsequently aggregated into files. (Note that these terms are indicative only. Different electronic records management systems employ different terminology.) Records are often aggregated at three levels of granularity according to a three-tiered functional classification scheme as follows: \n",

The introductory text to each section provides summary information regarding the records management concept and the overarching aim of the subsequent requirements. \n",
      "While they do not cover common system management and design requirements, such as interoperability, scalability and performance, it is acknowledged that such processes also support the recordkeeping functionality of the system.

      "Records are created in a diverse range of formats, may comprise multiple individual objects (compound records), and are transmitted by a wide range of communication channels (workflows, email, postal mail).

      "1 Project Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a sub-charter to the JustIM Project charter and covers a pathfinder implementation of the JustIM Operational Platform (herein known as GCDOCS) within the Environment Canada Legal Services Unit.\n",
      "1.1 Project Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The department has been working with Open Text Content Server since 2009 as a replacement for its existing RDIMS and iRIMS products. As part of that development, the department participated in the GCDOCS proof of concept and pilot in 2010 /11 in conjunction with PWGSC, Treasury Board and the Canadian School for Public Service. While that pilot was able to demonstrate some of the base functionality and configuration of the Open Text product, it did not provide Justice with the necessary assessment of the Records Management capabilities of the product, nor did it adequately test the product in a real life practice of law scenario. This initiative will fill in the blanks by implementing a selected subset of the Environment Canada Legal Services Units client advisory business using GCDOCS.  \n",
      "1.2 Project Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of this initiative is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Business\n",
      "Only transactional files of relatively short duration will be considered. This will preclude any files with potential precedential value or files whose active lifecycle will extend past the end of the Pathfinder phase. Only files opened during the pathfinder period will be candidates for inclusion, there will be no importing of historical information. Files will be managed from Opening phase through disposition. Functionality. Operational Platform services will be limited to core lifecycle services (file and find model) along with scanning function. \n",
      "\n",
      "Information\n",
      "Only Protected B level records and below will be included in the pathfinder. Files included in the pathfinder will need to be duplicated in iRIMS to ensure integration with iCase as no integration of iCase with GCDOCS is planned at this time.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Deployment\n",
      "The pathfinder will be deployed to a subset of lawyers within the LSU, the names of which will be provided by the LSU. Currently there are about 33 lawyers in the LSU, with an estimated 25 participating in the pathfinder. Access to GCDOCS will be through the Justice Virtual Desktop, which is currently deployed to all EC DLSU staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timeframe\n",
      "The pathfinder will end by March 31, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platform\n",
      "Only end user workstation / laptops with the VDI interface will be supported for the Pathfinder. Devices such as Blackberries are out-of-scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Project Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Project objectives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Assess the Records Management capabilities of GCDOCS for electronic records\n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS platform to support the advisory law practice line of business\n",
      "* Assess the capability of GCDOCS to support sustainable development and green enterprise through the paperless office\" concept. \n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS / VDI platform to support the DLSU business model integration with the host department\n",

      "1.1 Executive Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Information is the lifeblood of the Department of Justice, and the department has long recognized its importance. The department initiated a capacity assessment of Information Management within the department early in fiscal year 2004 / 05. The result of this assessment indicated that the department could improve compliance in 11 of 12 Management of Government Information Policy (2003) requirements and developed a number of goals for the department to address the issues raised. From the assessment, IMB was asked to identify an action plan to achieve the goals identified. IMB developed a strategy to address the top three priorities which was subsequently approved by BIT.COM in November, 2004. Since that period, work has been underway in a number of areas, with the majority of progress made during the three year period from 2005/06 to 2008/09. The strategic goals and resultant initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "Resulting Initiative\n",
      "Develop a national standard for the classification and organization of information in the department\n",
      "A national file plan was developed and subsequently implemented in about half the department\n",
      "Standardize the Records Management function within the department\n",
      "The departmental records management application was standardized on version 9.1. of iRIMS and all the DLSUs were converted to a standard configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "Implement electronic records management throughout the department\n",
      "Implementation of RDIMS, at the time the government standard solution for electronic document management, was implemented to about 800 users \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the overall business goals havent changed, there have been a number of developments in policy, technology, the practice of law, and the structure of government services that have necessitated a review of the original approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the policy side, a new Record Keeping Directive (RKD) has been instituted by Treasury Board mandating information management standards in all departments by 2014. While Justice does a good job of meeting the requirements of the RKD in the physical object (paper) world, it falls well short in the electronic document space. Library and Archives Canada has also announced it will no longer accept physical objects as of 2017, making the need to move to a paperless office environment more urgent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original technology choices to support IM have proved to be outmoded and obsolete. Technology has evolved from traditional application architectures to web and cloud based ones and the department has found itself with outmoded applications that not only do not meet the needs of the department but also prevent it from upgrading its IT infrastructure due to compatibility issues with modern operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The explosion of electronic information including new formats such as twitter, instant messaging et al and its impact on the practice of law (e-discovery etc.) make the ability to effectively manage electronic records critical if we are to have advantage in the courtrooms of the 21st century and deliver the quality of service to our clients expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The government has also moved recently to streamline the generic services it consumes and to reduce the deficit through cut-backs. There are three components of the government direction that impact the original IM plan:\n",
      "1. Grouping of all IT network and hosting services under a single department (Shared Services Canada)\n",
      "2. Proclamation of GCDOCS as the Government IM Product standard\n",
      "3. IM Cluster hosting model for GCDOCS users  \n",
      "1.1.1 Project Goals and Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Project objectives are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All records operations services for the department will be delivered using GCDOCS\n",
      "2. The department will adopt the government standard for records management\n",
      "3. A modern, robust foundation for managing electronic records will be in place\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.2 Major Milestones\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Standardization of the existing Records Management product (iRIMS) databases in preparation for conversion to GCDOCS\n",
      "2. Development of a  means of moving existing iRIMS information into GCDOCS\n",
      "3. Integration of iCase with GCDOCS to mimic the current iRIMS functionality\n",
      "4. Conversion of the existing iRIMS databases to GCDOCS RM, separating PPSC and JUS records into separate instances, and re-training of all users.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.1 Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The IM Project will implement standard records and document management processes and products throughout the department. It will provide the foundation to define and capture all operational business records and manage them through the information lifecycle by implementing a single enterprise repository of record in the department with the goal that it will house all non-evidentiary business records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "The objectives of the IM Project are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The department will address all issues raised in the IM audit report\n",
      "* The department will meet all IM policy and legislative requirements \n",
      "* The department will realize benefits and savings from more effective and efficient IM capabilities\n",
      "* A solid IM foundation for developing, delivering and supporting legal services in the 21st century within the department will be established\n",
      " \n",
      "1.3 Departmental Initiative Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has links to every initiative having an information management impact or dimension to it, of which there are many. These have been grouped in to five categories: (1) GoC Strategic initiatives; (2) implementation of GoC Policy and Standards; (3) IMB Strategic initiatives; (4) Law Practice initiatives; and (5) other IMSD initiatives. The overall context can be pictured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "National File Plan\n",
      "Development and implementation of a national, standard taxonomy to be used to classify records. Began in 2006, approximately 50% of staff are currently using the standard. Historically, adoption of the national file plan was a pre-requisite to GCDOCS implementation for a business unit and is a much desirable prelude to implementing electronic document management. If not, converting existing file plans to the standard will have to be done in GCDOCS.\n",
      ".\n",
      "New RDA\n",
      "The new Record Disposition Authority will dictate the number and nature of RSIs that must be configured in GCDOCS RM\n",
      "\n",
      "Back Log Reduction\n",
      "Throughout the years, the department has accumulated many files that have been closed, but never disposed of. This initiative provides funding to bring in resources to process the backlogged closed files according to the RSI.\n",
      " \n",
      "Revised retention period for legal files\n",
      "The department has undertaken to reduce the retention period for legal files to 12 years from the current standard. This will have a major impact on back log reduction as it will add a multi-year complement to files in the year it is adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justipedia (KM)\n",
      "Implementation of the legal knowledge management portal in the department. Electronic records flagged as being of interest to KM must be harvested from existing electronic repositories.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCase \n",
      "iCase currently uses iRIMS for file management and there is a tight integration between the two systems. iCase also manages its own document library which has limited DM functionality at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "e-Services\n",
      "e-Services include a number of legal support IM services such as e-discovery, e-filing, holds and proof of  service\n",
      "\n",
      "Law Practice Model\n",
      "GCDOCS must be configured to support the Law Practice model such as having a single file for a case regardless of who works on it and where they are located.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services Hosting\n",
      "The government has initiated the consolidation of IT Servers and networks under a single organization, Shared Services Canada. This group will need to be part of the project team in the architecture, design and implementation of GCDOCS related infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services GCDOCS\n",
      "Treasury Board has undertaken to become the custodian of the GCDOCS product and to coordinate the establishment of GCDOCS Application Service Providers and to themselves provide a Secret level hosting service. How Justice adopts this model will impact how hosting of GCDOCS is delivered and may impose certain design restrictions on the team\n",
      "\n",
      "Deficit Reduction Action Plan\n",
      "The DRAP program will impact how the department is organized and how some services are delivered. Organizational or functional changes affect the file plan and disposition authorities. The project may also be able to assist clients in achieving DRAP goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Admin Services Review\n",
      "Admin Services review may affect structure and service delivery of admin services. This will impact how GCDOCS is configured and implemented in these areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information Strategy\n",
      "The information strategy will define what types of information will need to be managed and how it will be leveraged\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Transformation\n",
      "The business transformation initiative will change the structure and service delivery of IMB. This may impact the projects ability to recruit resources as well manage change\n",
      "1.4 Assumptions, Constraints and Risks\n",
      "1.4.1 Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Regional Implementation Teams will be used for regional implementation\n",
      "2. Multi-year funding for the project will be found within the department\n",
      "3. GCDOCS platform will be the Departmental solution for both Records Management and Document Management\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.2 Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hosting solution must be decided and constructed\n",
      "2. Project funding must be found through departmental sources\n",
      "3. Anticipated funding levels of no more than $1.8M per year will be available\n",
      "4. Solution must accommodate records up to the Secret level.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.3 Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rate of change planned in the department may prove more than can be absorbed by the end users.\n",
      "2. The upheaval and uncertainty caused by budget cuts and government structural changes creates several challenges:\n",
      "a. Uncertainty during the transition creates a distraction for resources needed to perform project tasks\n",
      "b. Organizational changes in structure and management creates a vacuum in day-to-day management especially where turnover of manager level resources and above results.\n",
      "3. The restrictions on staffing imposed by DRAP and Business Transformation makes it very difficult to fill technical positions putting the schedule at risk if qualified resources cannot be recruited.\n",
      "4. Implementation in the Department Legal Services Units (DLSUs) requires the cooperation of the host department and may impact processes and interaction between DoJ staff and clients\n",
      "5. Given the length of time forecast for implementation:\n",
      "a. upgrades to both product and infrastructure may have to be implemented over the implementation period\n",
      "b. the department may not be able to meet all the target dates for the Record Keeping Directive and potentially the Library and Archives Canada (LAC) Digital Archive standard.\n",
      "6. Given the requirement for internal funding the department may not be able to afford 100% conformance to all IM stadndards \n",

      "2.1 Project Scope Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Meeting Information Management requirements as a whole is a very large undertaking. It is a challenge to maintain a picture of the overall scope of IM while at the same time dealing with the specifics in more digestible chunks.  Towards this end, at the highest level it has been divided into three sub-projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "iRIMS Standardization\n",
      "Brings all 42 iRIMS databases within the department up to a single standard configuration and consolidating some sites where practical\n",

      "GCDOCS RM Implementation\n",
      "Gets the department off iRIMS and onto GCDOCS RM module for managing physical records and establishing the foundation for managing electronic records.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS DM Implementation\n",
      "Implements electronic records management throughout the department\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these sub-projects is self-contained to the point they can be executed as discrete initiatives, with the proviso they must be done in the order given. They do, however, share common components in three areas that are addressed at the project, not sub-project, level:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Management\n",
      "Each sub-project will use the same Project Office and project management framework\n",
      "\n",
      "IT Infrastructure\n",
      "Each sub-project shares IT Infrastructure in terms of products, instances, end users, and service management\n",
      "\n",
      "Program Management\n",
      "Each sub-project affects Records Operations, the National IM Business Model and IM Policy, \n",
      "\n",
      "The overall picture is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The three sub-projects have themselves been sub-divided into components as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sub-project structure is addressed in detail in section 3.0\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Project Delivery Architecture \n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery of the IM project has been decomposed into three models: Work; Methodology; and Plan. Each is in relationship to the other as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Each also has a structure, or architecture, of its own as described below. A detailed Project Structure diagram can be found in RDIMS #201377 (full size version 11X17) and as a smaller version in Appendix A.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 Work Breakdown Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Work structure describes the services and resources that need to be delivered to support IM. It defines what needs to be done. It consists of facets, components and work packages. There are five key Facet level deliverables:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Management Infrastructure\n",
      "The components and work packages required to build the Project Management infrastructure needed to manage the project over its lifespan. \n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS Operational Platform\n",
      "The components and work packages required to deliver fundamental document and records management resources to end users along with the required operational support and management structure. The GCDOCS Operational platform has both a Records Management and Document Management component. Work packages in this facet are further grouped into functional releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS Enterprise Platform\n",
      "The components and work packages required to integrate core records and document management with other enterprise applications and services such as Case Management and KM. Work packages in this facet are grouped in terms of functional releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operations & Support\n",
      "The components and work packages required to deliver IT and Records Operations support to end users for the life of IM products\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical Data Transition\n",
      "The current inventory of historical archives and repositories containing Justice paper and electronic records that must be converted to GCDOCS. Work packages in this facet can be grouped by source repository technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS is divided into two groups of services referred to as platforms: operational and enterprise. Operational services are the generic records and document services required to meet the core functional requirements for IM.

      "5.2 Project Management Office\n",
      "\n",
      "A key aspect of the project management framework is establishing a Project Management Office capable of supporting the broad range of activities and deliverables across the project while ensuring all day-to-day operational and corporate staff and reporting requirements are met. To do this, the PMO will provide the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "General Administration\n",
      "The PMO will support sound management for the project through the provisions of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Financial administration by maintaining the project books showing up-to-date budget, forecast and expenditure management figures\n",
      "2. Support staffing initiatives in the project and maintaining an up-to-date org  chart\n",
      "3. Ensuring all corporate and internal reporting requirements are met on time\n",
      "4. Tracking client satisfaction and ensuring follow-up surveys are completed as per plan\n",
      "5. Acting as a coordinator for dispatching IM related Help Desk tickets\n",
      "Project Administration\n",
      "The PMO will provide the day-to-day administration functions to implement and support the management frameworks noted in 5.1 above and supporting functions.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Training Office\n",
      "Given the criticality of the training function in GCDOCS and the extent of the work involved to define and deliver training to 6,000 people, a separate Training Office for GCDOCS should be established. This office will be responsible for the following deliverables:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define and develop the entire training curriculum for end users, whether Records Operations, Clients or support staff\n",
      "2. Define and develop the training infrastructure required to deliver the curriculum\n",
      "Schedule and deliver training in coordination with the implementation plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Resource Management\n",
      "Resource Management functions include Accommodation, project related training, contract administration and the recording, inventory and disposal of all project assets.\n",

      "\n",
      "5.3 Project Planning \n",
      "\n",
      "To date, committed multi-year funding has not been available to the project. To accommodate this, the project will work on a regime of fiscal year plans that will be a subset of the master plan. This will require that each year, the project submit a funding proposal for work to be accomplished in the relevant year. It is anticipated the project will take at least 5 years to complete given historic funding levels. The work plans have laid out the entire scope of all that needs to be done to implement GCDOCS department-wide. The work plans themselves have been set up to allow filtering of tasks based on a number of criteria. As part of the operational planning process at the start of each fiscal year, the Project Manager will prioritize the remaining tasks in the work plan based on budget expectations and select a subset of activities to form the funding submission for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3.1 Managing Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the size of the IM project in general, the approach will be to define a series of sub-projects, with a general duration of no more than two years. Charters will be developed at the sub-project level. This will align more closely with the realities of the department. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sub-projects can run concurrently if there are sufficient resources available to do so. Unless multi-year funding is obtained, each sub-project will prepare an annual funding submission and plan as part of the corporate governance process. As noted, there are currently three generic sub-projects defined: iRIMS Standardization, GCDOCS RM Implementation and GCDOCS DM Implementation. Given the size and effort required for GCDOCS DM implementation, it may be split into further sub-projects, potentially on a regional basis (i.e. treat DM implementation in each region as a sub-project). Components of each can also be bundled as a sub-project.\n",
      "5.4 Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance for the project can be pictured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance occurs on two planes: (1) Internal governance and; (2) External. \n",
      "5.4.1 Internal Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal governance provides the framework for direction and decision within the department proper. It is accomplished through four areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The IMB Executive provides day-to-day monitoring and operational direction to the project. It consists of the CIO, IMB Executive, and the Project Sponsor.\n",
      "2. The Steering Committee is composed of representative stakeholders in the client and partner realms. Membership in the client area changes as implementation proceeds.\n",
      "3. IM / IT Governance covers the various committees established within the department to monitor and define IT standards and practices. It provides direction in the areas of technology choices.\n",
      "4. Corporate governance makes investment decisions and sets departmental priorities.  \n",
      "5.4.2 External Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "External governance provides the framework for direction and decision to align departmental initiatives with the government as a whole. There are two main interfaces:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Treasury Board of Canada has several broad governance facets:\n",
      "a. It defines IT and IM policy and standards for the government as a whole. The project will ensure that IM Policy and directives requirements are incorporated into the GCDOCS solution.\n",
      "b. It defines the project management framework for the government as a whole. The project will adopt the framework elements defined by TB.\n",
      "c. It is the approval / monitoring body for major departmental initiatives. Project approval is obtained through the departmental Investment Plan, PCRA and OPMCA submission to Treasury Board. \n",
      "2. Shared Services Canada hosts all network and servers for the government as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interface to external governance is done through the appropriate internal governance mechanism. The corporate governance model manages the interface to Treasury Board and the Branch IM / IT Governance model manages the interface to Shared Services Canada,\n",
      "6 Project Organization\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 Project Team\n",
      "\n",
      "A key strategy for the project is to create virtual project team whereby a project team is set up in each region to support the HQ project team. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.1 Team Structure\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.2 Regional Team Integration \n",
      "\n",
      "An IM project team will be established in each region to manage all the local activities required to implement IM standards in the region. The regional team will report directly to the regional IM / IT Director but also have a line reporting relationship to the HQ Team lead for their area of focus (business or IT). The IM / IT Director will work with the project manager to develop funding submissions and work plans for the year as well as provide regular status reports and financial updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regional teams will use the project defined management and project administration frameworks and file all records to the projects GCDOCS repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall project team will be subdivided into business, training and technical communities to focus on specific deliverables, problems, and issues affecting each. Each community will hold regular virtual meetings to review progress and address bottlenecks. All resources will be tasked with specific deliverables\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Roles and Responsibilities\n",
      "\n",
      "The Project Team has been organized along functional responsibility into six teams. In addition there are direct dependencies to the Policy & Projects and Records Operations sections of IMSD to partner in the development of the Policy and Records Operations components of IM as well as to the regional IM / IT teams who will be responsible to implement IM in the regional offices. There is a Team Charter for each team that defines the roles and responsibilities each team has. Also, each component of the Work Breakdown Structure (RIDMS #26669) is colour coded as to which team has primary responsibility for delivery. The details can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Office\n",
      "Provides admin support to the project team (meeting management, finance etc.), and manages communications for the project. It also provides Project Management support to the regions in terms of PM infrastructure. The Project Manager is considered part of the Project Office for budgetary purposes. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical Team\n",
      "Provides IT infrastructure and application management for other five teams. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Team\n",

      " \n",
      "Training Office\n",
      "Develops all training materials, provides training and coaching to end users in all IM disciplines and products as well as trains regional Trainers. Refer to Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Transition Team\n",
      "Develops conversion strategies and utilities for transferring electronic records from current systems to the new IM platform. Also develops strategies and frameworks to operate parallel systems for the implementation period. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "IMSD\n",
      "Responsible for the development of IM Policy and IM Operations procedures. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Regions\n",
      "Provides IM Implementation support at the regional level. Includes a subset of the functions of the Technical Team, DM Business Team, RM Business Team and file plan development. Refer to the Team Charter for details (see References 1.6).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 Partners\n",
      "\n",
      "The Project Team consists of both business and technical resources in HQ and in each region.\n",
      "The project Manager reports to the Director of IMSD who is also the business client. The Project Manager also has a delivery partnership with the regional IM / IT Directors for the coordination of regional work as well as budgeting and scheduling\n",
      "\n",
      "Public works may provide shared services in the IM domain and as such is a candidate for hosting the GCDOCS Operational Platform.\n",

      "\n",
      "Estimates are revised annually in line with each operational planning exercise. Project metrics collected during the year are used to refine estimating algorithms as more experience is gained with the technology, and constant process improvements are applied to the methodology.

As a general strategy, the Team Lead for each team is recruited first who is then responsible for recruiting / staffing his / her team.  For HQ, indeterminate staff will be recruited from existing IMB resources where they currently exist. Vacancies will be staffed using a variety of competitive process, transfers and secondments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contract resources will be acquired using a number of different approaches, depending on location and need. Where there are long-term generic continuing needs such as for business analysts, trainers, and technical analysts, TBIPS will be used for HQ needs. A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation will be provided to each region who will conduct their own contracting process using local firms. For specific one time activities related to the Project Office or speciality work, contracting vehicles appropriate to the budget and requirements will be selected as the need arises.\n",

All sites today are managing physical objects (paper) through iRIMS, and implementation of GCDOCS RM simply means transferring the function to GCDOCS. Only HQ and ORO are doing electronic records management today, for all other sites it will be a new service. Implementation will start with a pathfinder site, currently ARO, and after a short evaluation period (1 month), implementation will proceed to other regions where iRIMS standardization has been completed. Implementation can proceed in parallel. It is expected as well that the first sites to be implemented (ARO & PRO) will provide support as needed to other regions in their own implementations. The target model is to create a virtual records management team nation-wide capable of supporting any client.\n",

      "One of the challenges facing the department in implementing IM is that there has been a great deal of independence in defining business models and IM practices from organization to organization in the past. This is especially true region to region. This lack of a standard business model does not portend well for the project for several reasons: \n",
      "\n",

These architectures are referred to as superstructures since they are represented by a folder structure within GCDOCS that will be common to all groups within the area of discipline covered. Where possible the superstructure will also come per-configured with a file plan. Superstructure can be developed by function, organization or community of practice. The idea is to achieve an 80% coverage rule i.e. the superstructure meets 80% of any particular business units needs with the remaining 20% to be addressed as custom tailoring at the time of implementation. This has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required to implement electronic document management. Currently, the following superstructures have been defined:\n",

      "5.0\tMethodology \n",
      "\n",
      "5.1\tConfiguration\n",
      "BSAS created a SP2010 lab environment for the Gap Analysis.  It was installed according to the standard installation instructions that come with SP2010.  The BA Team asked that all functionality be enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "As testing progressed, additional support was sought from BSAS and eventually Microsoft.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For some of the FRs, the challenge was not the ability of SP2010 to do the function, it was the technical setup of the lab environment.  These were usually simple to correct once identified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of particular note, this evaluation is limited to what is available in the SP2010 license itself.  SP2010 must be able to meet the requirement without Addons or customization.  This is true even for the requirements worded alone or in conjunction with other systems.  The BA Team felt that no useful evaluation would have been possible if an indefinite list of possible Addons were included.  All FRs would have passed because somewhere out there someone probably has a system or could create one that could cause SP2010 to meet the requirement.  By limiting the evaluation to what is available with the purchase of an SP2010 license, the knowledge of what the SP2010 offering can provide is known and reported on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are a few FRs where the functionality required is more about the EDRMS being able to integrate than it is about functionality being delivered by an Addon.  These have been passed and an indication given that they were not fully tested. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Addon information has been included in the Group Notes whenever Microsoft named a specific Addon that could provide the additional functionality.  The Addons have not been tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2\tProcess\n",
      "SP2010 was evaluated against the JUS IM System Requirements 2011 through testing done by the BA Team.  The BA Team evaluated the requirements to the best of their ability and, where necessary, sought additional information from Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yes/No Rating indicates whether the functional or metadata requirement has been met at all by SP2010.  The Rating Scale (A+ to Fails) gives a subjective indicator of how well SP2010 meets the requirement.  The entire evaluation took place over several weeks.  Having all members of the BA Team available at all times was not possible but there were always at least two people on the BA Team involved in the evaluation of every requirement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where JUS would like to see improvement in SP2010 related to the requirement, this has been flagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BA Team included Robert Sguin, Derek Auger, Bryan Dewar, Josette Gaudreault, Krysta, St.Amand, and Angelique Everitt.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The BSAS resource assigned to create and support the environment was Francisco Braga.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCase representatives were consulted as necessary during the evaluation of iCase metadata and functional requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft was given the opportunity to review the failing items before the report was finalized. Microsoft attended several meetings and provided input as to how FRs could be met with SP2010.  The input received from them has been included.  They were unable to provide the resources to review and feedback on the GCRMFRs but they did review all other FRs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3\tAppendix C  Other Requirements\n",
      "The Other Requirements in Appendix C are not the typical requirements one finds in gap analyses.  These are requirements coming out of information management policies and directives.  They are usually more like statements of responsibility and no system can be evaluated against them.  A few are system-related and they have been identified in Appendix C.  The evaluation of most of these Other Requirements did not lend itself to the same Yes/No rating that worked for the Functional and Metadata Requirements so an explanation of how JUS is complying with the requirement has been provided by the various areas in IMSD responsible for these requirements.  The 7 system-related ones are reported on in 4.7 above.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.0 \tChallenges Encountered \n",
      "There were a variety of challenges encountered on the way to producing this Gap Analysis.  The following provides a brief overview of the main ones in chronological order:\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1\t Environment for the Gap Analysis\n",
      "It was several months of negotiating with TSD before an environment was made available for the IM Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 SP2010 Knowledge\n",
      "There was no training for the BA Team prior to starting the Gap Analysis.  Through the use of manuals and the vast Internet resources available on the subject of SharePoint, the BA Team was able to get about 70% of the FRs tested to their satisfaction.  For the remaining 30%, it was difficult to know if the system could not meet the requirement or the inability to find a way to meet the requirement was due to the lack of expertise or administrative privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, Microsofts review of the FRs was essential to the completion of the Gap Analysis.  There feedback was reviewed and the relevant FRs tested then the Gap Analysis was modified as appropriate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 ISO16175 Challenges\n",
      "Working with the ISO Standards was often quite difficult.  Terminology was the biggest problem.  The language used in 16175-2 is especially confusing when it comes to aggregations.  All of the following terms are used: aggregations, non-digital aggregations, digital aggregations, hybrid aggregations, hybrid non-digital aggregations, and hybrid digital aggregations.  Where the BAs involved in the Gap Analysis could agree on the likely meaning, the FR was evaluated.  For several of the FRs the meaning was so well hidden that the FR remains unevaluated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other challenge with the ISO Standards is the relationship amongst systems assumed by the Standards.  For these ISO Standards, the 16175-2 Module deals with finalized records in an ERMS and 16175-3 deals with in-process records in the DMS.  The assumption is that records are passed to the ERMS once finalized or in order to be finalized.  This does not match the physical reality of SP2010 which can lifecycle the records in the DMS.  This disconnect between the model assumed by the Standards and the reality of the solution being evaluated does make the evaluation process a bit muddier than it could be.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another difficulty was that there were differences in definitions between the -2 and -3 documents.  Sometimes things were defined differently.  Sometimes they were defined in one document but not the other.  \n",
      "\n",

      "* Several FRs included the following wording, creating or receiving digital records generated by electronic messaging systems.

      "1 INTRODUCTION \n",
      "Good management of records and information is fundamental to a well-functioning organisation since it supports business activity and provides a basis for efficient service delivery. It also provides the mechanism whereby both the private and public sectors can account for their decisions and actions. Records provide evidence for the public to confirm or claim their public rights and entitlements, as well as providing individuals with evidence to justify government decisions and a mechanism whereby they can have trust in private enterprise. Moreover, good records management is simply good business practice. \n",
      "Records management systems facilitate: \n",
      "\n",
      " efficiency, by making information readily available when needed for decision-making and operational activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " sound use of financial resources, by allowing timely disposal of non-current records; \n",
      "\n",
      " accountability, by enabling the creation of a complete and authoritative record of official activities; \n",
      "\n",
      " compliance, by demonstrating that legal requirements have been met; and \n",
      "\n",
      " risk mitigation, by managing the risks associated with illegal loss or destruction of records, and from inappropriate or unauthorised access to records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Scope \n",
      "A fundamental underlying principle is the distinction between business information systems (business systems) and electronic records management systems. Business systems contain data that is commonly subject to constant updates (dynamic), able to be transformed (manipulable) and only contain current data (non-redundant). By contrast, electronic records management systems contain data that is not dynamically linked to business activity (fixed), unable to be altered (inviolable), and may be non-current (redundant). Therefore business systems are beyond the scope of this Module (see Module 3: Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Records in Business Systems). The records within an electronic records management system are, however, still dynamic in the sense that they can be (re)used in new business activity/contexts, so new metadata will be added through the ongoing use of the record content. It is more appropriate to speak about a framework for the systematic and structured management of records; records management systems link records to business activities, retain records of past actions, and fix the content and structure of records over time. \n",
      "The scope of this Module is limited to products that are usually termed electronic records management systems. It does not seek to set requirements for records still in use within business systems. Digital objects created by email, word processing, spreadsheet and imaging applications (such as text documents, and still and moving images), where they are identified to be of business value, should be managed within electronic records management systems that meet the functional requirements in this Module. [1]Records managed by an electronic records management system may be stored on a variety of different media formats, and may be managed in hybrid record aggregations that include both electronic and non-electronic elements. \n",
      "This Module does not attempt to include requirements that are not specific to, or necessary for, records management, for example, general system management and design requirements. Nor does it include requirements common to all software applications, such as the performance, scalability and usability of the application. [2]Given the target audience of this document, it also assumes a level of knowledge about developing design specifications, procurement and evaluation processes, and therefore these issues are not covered in this Module. Although not included in this Modules requirements, the importance of non-records management functional requirements for records management systems is recognised through their inclusion in the high-level model outlined in Section 2.3: Overview of functional requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specifications for the long-term preservation of electronic records are also beyond the scope of this Module as this issue should be addressed separately by a dedicated strategy for digital preservation or electronic archiving. These electronic archiving considerations transcend the life of systems and are system independent; they need to be assessed in a specific longer-term strategic framework. However, recognition of the need to maintain records for as long as they are required must be addressed, and potential migration or format obsolescence issues should also be considered. Specific policies and procedures for these should be developed to support the longevity of records for permanent or long-term retention. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Purpose \n",
      "This Module articulates a set of functional requirements for electronic records management systems. These requirements apply to records irrespective of the media in which they were created and stored. They are intended to: \n",
      "\n",
      " explain processes and requirements for identifying and managing records in electronic records management systems; \n",
      "\n",
      " develop requirements for records management functionality to be included in a design specification when building, upgrading or purchasing electronic records management systems software; \n",
      "\n",
      " inform records management functional requirements in the selection of commercially available electronic records management systems; and \n",
      "\n",
      " review the records management functionality or assess compliance of existing electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Module has been developed as part of an International Council on Archives project designed to: \n",
      "\n",
      " assist organisations to improve electronic records management practices; \n",
      "\n",
      " reduce the duplication of effort and associated costs in identifying a minimum level of records management functionality for electronic records management systems; and \n",
      " establish greater standardisation of records management requirements for software vendors across different jurisdictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Audience \n",
      "The primary audience for this document is staff responsible for designing, reviewing and/or implementing electronic records management systems in organisations  whether those systems are commercial off-the-shelf electronic records management software applications, or custom-built applications. This Module primarily addresses the requirements of organisational records managers or system procurement project leaders, but will be relevant for jurisdictional standard-setters and the wider records management community. Another key audience is software vendors and developers who market and/or develop electronic records management system products. This Module is intended to inform their decision-making when designing records management functionality within electronic records management products. \n",
      "Given the primary target audience for this document, the authors have tried to minimise the use of specific records management terminology. Where the use of such terminology is necessary, definitions can be found in the Glossary at Appendix A. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Related standards \n",
      "Under its Electronic Records and Automation Priority Area, the International Council on Archives has developed a suite of guidelines and functional requirements as part of the Principles and Functional Requirements for Records in Electronic Office Environments project: \n",

      "[4]1.5 Terminology \n",
      "Many of the terms used in this document have differing definitions across disciplines. For example, the term archive may mean a storage of little-used data in a database to an IT audience, whereas it means the retention of fixed appraised information no longer retained for current business use within the records management discipline. It is therefore important that this document is read in conjunction with the Glossary at Appendix A. A number of the central concepts used in this document are also outlined below, to avoid misinterpretation: \n",
      "\n",
      " Records  information created, received and maintained as evidence and information by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.1 They provide evidence of business transactions and can exist in any format.   \n",
      "1 International Standard on Records Management, ISO 15489. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management  the control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposal of records in accordance with professional and international standards of practice. Records management is distinct from document management, which is typically concerned with the provision of access, collaborative working and version control of documents, rather than the management of authenticity, reliability, integrity and useability over time. \n",
      "\n",
      " Electronic records management systems (commonly referred to as EDRMS or ERMS)  systems specifically designed to manage the maintenance and disposition of records. They maintain the content, context, structure and links between records to enable their accessibility and support their value as evidence. Electronic records management systems are distinguished from business systems, for the purpose of this document, because their primary function is the management of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Business systems  automated systems that create or manage data about an organisations activities (for the purpose of this document). They include applications whose primary purpose is to facilitate transactions between an organisational unit and its customers, for example, an e-commerce system, client-relationship management system, purpose-built or customised database, and finance or human resources systems. Business systems typically contain dynamic data that is commonly subject to constant updates (timely), able to be transformed (manipulable) and holds current data (non-redundant). For the purpose of this document, business systems exclude electronic records management systems. \n",
      "\n",
      " System  use of the term system in this document refers to a computer or IT system. This is in contrast to the records management understanding of the term, which encompasses the broader aspects of people, policies, procedures and practices. While the focus of this Module is primarily electronic records management systems software, organisations will need to pay attention to wider aspects of records management frameworks, policies and tools to ensure records can be appropriately managed. For example, fundamental records management tools, such as disposition authorities and information security classifications, must be in place and operate within an established records management culture within the organisation. A system may comprise more than one application and include plug-ins. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata  an inextricable part of records management, serving a variety of functions and purposes. In a records management context, metadata is defined as data describing the context, content and structure of records and their management through time (ISO 15489  1: 2001, 3.12). As such, metadata is structured or semi-structured information that enables the creation, registration, classification, access, preservation and disposition of records through time and within and across domains. Records management metadata can be used to identify, authenticate and contextualise records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them, and the policies that govern them. Initially, metadata defines the record at its point of capture, fixing the record into its business context and establishing management control over it. During the existence of records or their aggregates, new layers of metadata will be added because of new roles in other business or usage contexts. This means that metadata continues to accrue information relating to the context of the records management and the business processes in which the records are used, and to structural changes to the record or its appearance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata can be sourced or re-used by multiple systems and for multiple purposes. Metadata applied to records during their active life may also continue to apply when the records cease to be required for current business purposes but are retained for ongoing research or other values. The purpose of records management metadata is to ensure authenticity, reliability, usability and integrity over time, and to enable the management and understanding of information objects, whether these are physical, analogue or electronic. However, metadata also needs to be managed as a record or as a component of a record. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records management has always involved the management of metadata. However, the electronic environment requires a different expression of traditional requirements and different mechanisms for identifying, capturing, attributing and using metadata. In the electronic environment, authoritative records are those accompanied by metadata defining their critical characteristics. These characteristics must be explicitly documented rather than being implicit, as in some paper-based processes. \n",

      "1.6 Structure \n",

      "Records are a valuable business asset. One of the key ways organisations are held accountable for their actions is through evidence of business transactions in the form of records. Records are information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information, by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.2 They must be retained for a period of time that is in line with an authorised retention schedule or disposition authority, sometimes referred to as a disposition. \n",
      "A record is not just a collection of data, but is the consequence or product of an event and therefore linked to business activities. A distinguishing feature of records is that their content must exist in a fixed form, that is, be a fixed representation of the business transaction. Managing records in business systems, which contain data that is frequently updated and dynamic, is particularly challenging and may provide a rationale for implementing a separate electronic records management system. Records comprise not only content but also information about the context and structure of the record. Records management metadata identifies, authenticates and contextualises records and the people, processes and systems that create, manage, maintain and use them and the policies that govern them.3 It allows records to be located, rendered and understood in a meaningful way. ISO/TS 23081  2 provides a generic statement of records management metadata elements. Organisations may also have jurisdiction-specific elements sets to which they must adhere. \n",

      "2.2 Characteristics of electronic records and electronic records management systems \n",
      "Once records have been created, they must be managed and maintained for as long as required to ensure they have the following characteristics:4\n",
      "\n",
      " Authenticity  the record can be proven to be what it purports to be, to have been created or sent by the person that created or sent it, and to have been created or sent at the time it is purported to have occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      " Reliability  the record can be trusted as a full and accurate representation of the transaction(s) to which they attest, and can be depended on in the course of subsequent transactions. \n",
      "\n",
      " Integrity  the record is complete and unaltered, and protected against unauthorised alteration. This characteristic is also referred to as inviolability. \n",
      "\n",
      " Usability  the record can be located, retrieved, preserved and interpreted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, electronic records management systems have the following attributes that seek to ensure these characteristics are maintained: \n",
      "\n",
      " Creating records in context  electronic records management systems enable organisations to capture evidence of their business activity. This involves identifying a set of electronic information to serve as the evidential record comprising both content and context. So, in order for information to have the capability of functioning as a record, it is necessary to augment that content information with additional data (that is, metadata) that places it in the context of the business operations and computing environment in which it was created. \n",
      "\n",
      " Managing and maintaining records  electronic records have to be actively managed as evidence of business activity, and to maintain their authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability. Maintenance of this evidence, as records, is necessary for operational viability and accountability of the organisation. \n",
      "\n",
      " Maintaining records for as long as they are required  records must be retained for a period of time that is in accordance with authorised legislative and jurisdictional requirements. Decisions about how long records must be retained are defined in disposition/disposal policies and rules. There will be some records that must be retained permanently while others will be required to be retained for varying periods or have a maximum retention period (for example, for privacy or data-protection legislative purposes). \n",
      "\n",
      "Records have to be able to be disposed of in a managed, systematic and auditable way. A hallmark of appropriate records management is the retention and appropriate disposition of records according to specified rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "Systems need to be able to delete records in a systematic, auditable and accountable way in line with operational and juridical requirements. Organisations will need to meet the policies and procedures of their local jurisdictional authority for identifying, retaining and disposing of records. \n",
      "\n",
      " Records management metadata can be configured  to be meaningful as evidence of a business process, records must be linked to the context of their creation and use. To do this, the record must be associated with metadata about the business context in a classification structure. In addition to this classification metadata, other metadata that should be captured at the point of creation includes: \n",
      " identifier; \n",
      " date of creation; \n",
      " creator/author/person responsible; and \n",
      " the business being conducted. \n",
      "Much of this information can be automatically generated. In this Module, integration of metadata for managing records is addressed at a relatively high level. Rather than specifically detailing every metadata element required, the functional requirements set instead provides broad references to the need to have functionality that is capable of creating, capturing and maintaining adequate metadata elements. It is expected that each organisation will capture records management metadata in line with an identified records management metadata standard, in accordance with organisational and/or jurisdictional requirements, and/or be consistent with ISO 23081  1: 2006, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 1  Principles; and ISO/TS 23081  2: 2007, Information and Documentation  Records Management Processes  Metadata for Records, Part 2  Conceptual and Implementation Issues. \n",

Any further processes that happen to the record after this point must result in the creation of a new record or the recorded augmentation/versioning of the existing record, rather than alteration to it. This means that content and metadata that need to be kept to record previous decisions or processes cannot be overwritten, but that new content or metadata can be added. \n",
      "It is important to ensure that the system is not locked down to such an extent that simple mistakes (such as mistyping a name) cannot be corrected  although permission for changes may be restricted to a system administrator or prevented by the system in exceptional circumstances, such as pending legal action. \n",

      "A risk assessment can inform business decisions as to how rigorous the controls need to be. For example, in a high-risk environment, it may be necessary to prove exactly what happened, when and by whom. This links to systems permissions and audit logging, to prove that approved actions are undertaken by authorised users. User requirements should be assigned at appropriate levels of access by an administrator. \n",

      "A user with special access permissions that allow additional access to, and/or control over, records contained in the electronic records management system. Authorised users may in some instances be assigned permissions to undertake tasks similar to those of the system administrator, such as the ability to close and re-open records, create extracts of records and edit record metadata.

      "The ability to import and export records, and interoperability with other systems, is frequently required functionality. Records may need to be exported to other organisations in the event of mergers or government re-organisational changes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many records may need to be retained for longer than the lifespan of the software system itself, and therefore there is a need to be able to export records when transitioning to a new electronic records management system. There may also be a need to import records from business systems, particularly in collaborative business environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "For ease of import and export, use of open formats and industry standards will increase levels of interoperability and reduce the cost and difficulty of any import/export process. \n",
      "\n",
      "This functionality must be addressed at the planning stages as part of the business requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.2 Authentication, encryption and technological protection measures \n",
      "These issues have an impact on the reliability of records issue. Electronic records management systems must allow records to be effectively managed when they have been subject to technological protection measures, electronic signatures and electronic watermarks (digital rights management). They should give particular consideration to the ongoing maintenance of records that have been subject to encryption and digital signatures. While encryption and digital signatures have a valuable role to play in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of records in transmission, they also present risks to the ongoing useability of the record as decryption keys and public keys for digital signatures may expire while the record is still required. For this reason, storing records in encrypted form is not recommended. Metadata can record the encryption and decryption processes and attest to the successful decryption of records. \n",
      "\n",
      "If digital signatures are used as a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of records, key management must be considered. Information about the digital signature and its validation should be recorded within the metadata. \n",

      "\n",
      "2.3.1 Create \n",
      "Capture \n",
      "Electronic records management systems uniquely capture, classify and identify records to ensure that their content, structure and context of creation are fixed in time and space. These records management processes facilitate the making of complete, authentic and usable records. There should be functionality to create a new record by reusing the content, structure and context of records once captured. While version/document control is beyond the scope of this Module it may also provide some of this functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Records aggregations \n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records are accumulations of related electronic record entities that, when combined, may exist at a level above that of a singular electronic record object, for example, a file. Aggregations represent relationships that exist between related electronic records and the system or environment in which they were created, and are recorded in their metadata links and/or other associations. These aggregations are typically controlled within a classification scheme in an electronic records management system. \n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic records management systems may contain aggregations of records, records that are not aggregated, or both. Records aggregations structure related electronic records and support their management and usability. They may be at more than one level, and may have multiple relationships within separate aggregations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aggregations of electronic records may reflect relationships such as shared characteristics or attributes, or the existence of sequential relationships between related electronic records. The nature of the relationship between the electronic records of a particular aggregation will vary depending on factors such as their purpose and structure, and the content and format of the records themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an aggregation of electronic records may collectively constitute a narrative of events (that is, a series of connected business transactions), in which the records may have a sequential relationship. Any such sequential relationship between electronic records can be determined through the metadata elements associated with the records, such as titles, dates, author, container number (where applicable), and other such attributes. Where these relationships exist between records imported or extracted from external business systems, the electronic records management system should be capable of identifying, capturing, documenting and preserving them. \n",
      "These aggregations may be formal, structured relationships (for example, digital files containing related digital documents), or may exist as less formalised, tightly bound metadata relationships recognised as establishing links between related records within an aggregation. \n",
      "The aggregations must be fixed and maintained over time. Any change to an aggregation must be logged with an explanation. Aggregation for the management of records purposes should not be confused with, or replaced by, the generation of multiple, different aggregations in response to search requests or report queries. \n",
      "Figure 2: Aggregation of records \n",
      "Identification (registration) \n",
      "To verify their existence within the system, every record and associated aggregation must have a unique identifier persistently linked to it. This allows the user to locate records and helps them to distinguish between versions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Classification \n",
      "Within electronic records management systems implementations, aggregations are often used to enable inheritance of characteristics to records created or related at a lower level of aggregation. Typically in electronic records management systems, information is managed as record objects, and aggregates these objects into a set of series or files. Agencies should take into account their own business needs when determining suitable records aggregations (for example, by function, activity or transaction) within their agency. Within a business classification scheme, a records contextual characteristics are attributed through structuring them according to identifiable business processes. \n",

      "Record object \n",
      "\n",
      "File level \n",
      "Record object Series level Record object Record component Sub-file or volume-level aggregation (where applicable) \n",
      "\n",
      "Subject-based classification schemes will allow records relating to broad subject areas to be grouped together, that is, the transactions and activities that occurred under a single subject, such as a particular property or client. However, under subject-based classification, the focus is on what the item or object is about, rather than on the purpose or activity that the record was created to document. Therefore, the context of the business activity can become disassociated, making disposal actions over subject-based files more difficult as they will contain records with differing retention periods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Functional classification schemes are based on an analysis of the unique business functions and activities of an organisation, and are independent of the organisations administrative structure. This makes functional classification more flexible and stable as business units and structures are likely to change over time. This system breaks down traditional organisational information silos and enables easier retention and disposal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Business classification scheme \n",
      "A business classification scheme is a conceptual hierarchical classification tool that can facilitate the capture, titling, retrieval, maintenance and disposition of records. It defines the way in which records are grouped together (aggregated) and linked to the business context in which they were created or transmitted. For example, individual records in an organisation-wide electronic records management system may be aggregated into series with their constituent record parts and contextual metadata, or may be subsequently aggregated into files. (Note that these terms are indicative only. Different electronic records management systems employ different terminology.) Records are often aggregated at three levels of granularity according to a three-tiered functional classification scheme as follows: \n",

      "\n",
      "This is a sub-charter to the JustIM Project charter and covers a pathfinder implementation of the JustIM Operational Platform (herein known as GCDOCS) within the Environment Canada Legal Services Unit.\n",
      "1.1 Project Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The department has been working with Open Text Content Server since 2009 as a replacement for its existing RDIMS and iRIMS products. As part of that development, the department participated in the GCDOCS proof of concept and pilot in 2010 /11 in conjunction with PWGSC, Treasury Board and the Canadian School for Public Service. While that pilot was able to demonstrate some of the base functionality and configuration of the Open Text product, it did not provide Justice with the necessary assessment of the Records Management capabilities of the product, nor did it adequately test the product in a real life practice of law scenario. This initiative will fill in the blanks by implementing a selected subset of the Environment Canada Legal Services Units client advisory business using GCDOCS.  \n",
      "1.2 Project Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of this initiative is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Business\n",
      "Only transactional files of relatively short duration will be considered. This will preclude any files with potential precedential value or files whose active lifecycle will extend past the end of the Pathfinder phase. Only files opened during the pathfinder period will be candidates for inclusion, there will be no importing of historical information. Files will be managed from Opening phase through disposition. Functionality. Operational Platform services will be limited to core lifecycle services (file and find model) along with scanning function. \n",
      "\n",
      "Information\n",
      "Only Protected B level records and below will be included in the pathfinder. Files included in the pathfinder will need to be duplicated in iRIMS to ensure integration with iCase as no integration of iCase with GCDOCS is planned at this time.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Deployment\n",
      "The pathfinder will be deployed to a subset of lawyers within the LSU, the names of which will be provided by the LSU. Currently there are about 33 lawyers in the LSU, with an estimated 25 participating in the pathfinder. Access to GCDOCS will be through the Justice Virtual Desktop, which is currently deployed to all EC DLSU staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timeframe\n",
      "The pathfinder will end by March 31, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platform\n",
      "Only end user workstation / laptops with the VDI interface will be supported for the Pathfinder. Devices such as Blackberries are out-of-scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Project Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Project objectives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Assess the Records Management capabilities of GCDOCS for electronic records\n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS platform to support the advisory law practice line of business\n",
      "* Assess the capability of GCDOCS to support sustainable development and green enterprise through the paperless office\" concept. \n",
      "* Assess the capability of the GCDOCS / VDI platform to support the DLSU business model integration with the host department\n",

      "1.1 Executive Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Information is the lifeblood of the Department of Justice, and the department has long recognized its importance. The department initiated a capacity assessment of Information Management within the department early in fiscal year 2004 / 05. The result of this assessment indicated that the department could improve compliance in 11 of 12 Management of Government Information Policy (2003) requirements and developed a number of goals for the department to address the issues raised. From the assessment, IMB was asked to identify an action plan to achieve the goals identified. IMB developed a strategy to address the top three priorities which was subsequently approved by BIT.COM in November, 2004. Since that period, work has been underway in a number of areas, with the majority of progress made during the three year period from 2005/06 to 2008/09. The strategic goals and resultant initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "Resulting Initiative\n",
      "Develop a national standard for the classification and organization of information in the department\n",
      "A national file plan was developed and subsequently implemented in about half the department\n",
      "Standardize the Records Management function within the department\n",
      "The departmental records management application was standardized on version 9.1. of iRIMS and all the DLSUs were converted to a standard configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "Implement electronic records management throughout the department\n",
      "Implementation of RDIMS, at the time the government standard solution for electronic document management, was implemented to about 800 users \n",
      "\n",
      "While the overall business goals havent changed, there have been a number of developments in policy, technology, the practice of law, and the structure of government services that have necessitated a review of the original approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the policy side, a new Record Keeping Directive (RKD) has been instituted by Treasury Board mandating information management standards in all departments by 2014. While Justice does a good job of meeting the requirements of the RKD in the physical object (paper) world, it falls well short in the electronic document space. Library and Archives Canada has also announced it will no longer accept physical objects as of 2017, making the need to move to a paperless office environment more urgent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original technology choices to support IM have proved to be outmoded and obsolete. Technology has evolved from traditional application architectures to web and cloud based ones and the department has found itself with outmoded applications that not only do not meet the needs of the department but also prevent it from upgrading its IT infrastructure due to compatibility issues with modern operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The explosion of electronic information including new formats such as twitter, instant messaging et al and its impact on the practice of law (e-discovery etc.) make the ability to effectively manage electronic records critical if we are to have advantage in the courtrooms of the 21st century and deliver the quality of service to our clients expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The government has also moved recently to streamline the generic services it consumes and to reduce the deficit through cut-backs. There are three components of the government direction that impact the original IM plan:\n",
      "1. Grouping of all IT network and hosting services under a single department (Shared Services Canada)\n",
      "2. Proclamation of GCDOCS as the Government IM Product standard\n",
      "3. IM Cluster hosting model for GCDOCS users  \n",
      "1.1.1 Project Goals and Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Project objectives are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All records operations services for the department will be delivered using GCDOCS\n",
      "2. The department will adopt the government standard for records management\n",
      "3. A modern, robust foundation for managing electronic records will be in place\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.2 Major Milestones\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Standardization of the existing Records Management product (iRIMS) databases in preparation for conversion to GCDOCS\n",
      "2. Development of a  means of moving existing iRIMS information into GCDOCS\n",
      "3. Integration of iCase with GCDOCS to mimic the current iRIMS functionality\n",
      "4. Conversion of the existing iRIMS databases to GCDOCS RM, separating PPSC and JUS records into separate instances, and re-training of all users.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.3 Key Deliverables\n",
      "\n",
      "1. iRIMS Standardization Framework\n",
      "2. Standardized iRIMS databases\n",
      "3. iCase / GCDOCS Integration\n",
      "4. iRIMS to GCDOCS Conversion Framework\n",
      "5. GCDOCS IT Infrastructure\n",
      "6. Program Management Infrastructure\n",
      "7. Training Infrastructure\n",
      "8. RDIMS Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.4 Key Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Early pioneers of iRIMS conversion\n",
      "2. Departmental / Governmental Transition Turmoil\n",
      "3. Staffing challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.5 Estimated Total Cost\n",

As a result the final effort and cost for this crucial activity is quite volatile. Should a 3rd party product be part of the solution that costs more than $25K, procurement will have to be handled through PWGSC adding months to the schedule\n",
      "H\n",
      "H\n",
      "Three strategies are being explored simultaneously:\n",
      "1. Use products / scripts supplied by Open Text as part or GOC license. \n",

      "\n",
      "1.1 Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The IM Project will implement standard records and document management processes and products throughout the department. It will provide the foundation to define and capture all operational business records and manage them through the information lifecycle by implementing a single enterprise repository of record in the department with the goal that it will house all non-evidentiary business records. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "The objectives of the IM Project are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The department will address all issues raised in the IM audit report\n",
      "* The department will meet all IM policy and legislative requirements \n",
      "* The department will realize benefits and savings from more effective and efficient IM capabilities\n",
      "* A solid IM foundation for developing, delivering and supporting legal services in the 21st century within the department will be established\n",
      " \n",
      "1.3 Departmental Initiative Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has links to every initiative having an information management impact or dimension to it, of which there are many. These have been grouped in to five categories: (1) GoC Strategic initiatives; (2) implementation of GoC Policy and Standards; (3) IMB Strategic initiatives; (4) Law Practice initiatives; and (5) other IMSD initiatives. The overall context can be pictured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "National File Plan\n",
      "Development and implementation of a national, standard taxonomy to be used to classify records. Began in 2006, approximately 50% of staff are currently using the standard. Historically, adoption of the national file plan was a pre-requisite to GCDOCS implementation for a business unit and is a much desirable prelude to implementing electronic document management. If not, converting existing file plans to the standard will have to be done in GCDOCS.\n",
      ".\n",
      "New RDA\n",
      "The new Record Disposition Authority will dictate the number and nature of RSIs that must be configured in GCDOCS RM\n",
      "\n",
      "Back Log Reduction\n",
      "Throughout the years, the department has accumulated many files that have been closed, but never disposed of. This initiative provides funding to bring in resources to process the backlogged closed files according to the RSI.\n",
      " \n",
      "Revised retention period for legal files\n",
      "The department has undertaken to reduce the retention period for legal files to 12 years from the current standard. This will have a major impact on back log reduction as it will add a multi-year complement to files in the year it is adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justipedia (KM)\n",
      "Implementation of the legal knowledge management portal in the department. Electronic records flagged as being of interest to KM must be harvested from existing electronic repositories.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCase \n",
      "iCase currently uses iRIMS for file management and there is a tight integration between the two systems. iCase also manages its own document library which has limited DM functionality at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "e-Services\n",
      "e-Services include a number of legal support IM services such as e-discovery, e-filing, holds and proof of  service\n",
      "\n",
      "Law Practice Model\n",
      "GCDOCS must be configured to support the Law Practice model such as having a single file for a case regardless of who works on it and where they are located.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services Hosting\n",
      "The government has initiated the consolidation of IT Servers and networks under a single organization, Shared Services Canada. This group will need to be part of the project team in the architecture, design and implementation of GCDOCS related infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared Services GCDOCS\n",
      "Treasury Board has undertaken to become the custodian of the GCDOCS product and to coordinate the establishment of GCDOCS Application Service Providers and to themselves provide a Secret level hosting service. How Justice adopts this model will impact how hosting of GCDOCS is delivered and may impose certain design restrictions on the team\n",
      "\n",
      "Deficit Reduction Action Plan\n",
      "The DRAP program will impact how the department is organized and how some services are delivered. Organizational or functional changes affect the file plan and disposition authorities. The project may also be able to assist clients in achieving DRAP goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Admin Services Review\n",
      "Admin Services review may affect structure and service delivery of admin services. This will impact how GCDOCS is configured and implemented in these areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information Strategy\n",
      "The information strategy will define what types of information will need to be managed and how it will be leveraged\n",
      "\n",
      "Business Transformation\n",
      "The business transformation initiative will change the structure and service delivery of IMB. This may impact the projects ability to recruit resources as well manage change\n",
      "1.4 Assumptions, Constraints and Risks\n",
      "1.4.1 Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Regional Implementation Teams will be used for regional implementation\n",
      "2. Multi-year funding for the project will be found within the department\n",
      "3. GCDOCS platform will be the Departmental solution for both Records Management and Document Management\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.2 Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hosting solution must be decided and constructed\n",
      "2. Project funding must be found through departmental sources\n",
      "3. Anticipated funding levels of no more than $1.8M per year will be available\n",
      "4. Solution must accommodate records up to the Secret level.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.3 Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rate of change planned in the department may prove more than can be absorbed by the end users.\n",
      "2. The upheaval and uncertainty caused by budget cuts and government structural changes creates several challenges:\n",
      "a. Uncertainty during the transition creates a distraction for resources needed to perform project tasks\n",
      "b. Organizational changes in structure and management creates a vacuum in day-to-day management especially where turnover of manager level resources and above results.\n",
      "3. The restrictions on staffing imposed by DRAP and Business Transformation makes it very difficult to fill technical positions putting the schedule at risk if qualified resources cannot be recruited.\n",
      "4. Implementation in the Department Legal Services Units (DLSUs) requires the cooperation of the host department and may impact processes and interaction between DoJ staff and clients\n",
      "5. Given the length of time forecast for implementation:\n",
      "a. upgrades to both product and infrastructure may have to be implemented over the implementation period\n",
      "b. the department may not be able to meet all the target dates for the Record Keeping Directive and potentially the Library and Archives Canada (LAC) Digital Archive standard.\n",
      "6. Given the requirement for internal funding the department may not be able to afford 100% conformance to all IM stadndards \n",

      "\n",
      "Meeting Information Management requirements as a whole is a very large undertaking. It is a challenge to maintain a picture of the overall scope of IM while at the same time dealing with the specifics in more digestible chunks.  Towards this end, at the highest level it has been divided into three sub-projects:\n",

      "\n",
      "Each of these sub-projects is self-contained to the point they can be executed as discrete initiatives, with the proviso they must be done in the order given. They do, however, share common components in three areas that are addressed at the project, not sub-project, level:\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Management\n",
      "Each sub-project will use the same Project Office and project management framework\n",
      "\n",
      "IT Infrastructure\n",

      "\n",
      "The three sub-projects have themselves been sub-divided into components as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The sub-project structure is addressed in detail in section 3.0\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Project Delivery Architecture \n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery of the IM project has been decomposed into three models: Work; Methodology; and Plan. Each is in relationship to the other as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      " Each also has a structure, or architecture, of its own as described below. A detailed Project Structure diagram can be found in RDIMS #201377 (full size version 11X17) and as a smaller version in Appendix A.\n",

      "2.2.1 Work Breakdown Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Work structure describes the services and resources that need to be delivered to support IM. It defines what needs to be done. It consists of facets, components and work packages. There are five key Facet level deliverables:\n",

      "GCDOCS Operational Platform\n",
      "The components and work packages required to deliver fundamental document and records management resources to end users along with the required operational support and management structure. The GCDOCS Operational platform has both a Records Management and Document Management component. Work packages in this facet are further grouped into functional releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCDOCS Enterprise Platform\n",

      "\n",
      "GCDOCS is divided into two groups of services referred to as platforms: operational and enterprise. Operational services are the generic records and document services required to meet the core functional requirements for IM. It integrates GCDOCS with the generic authoring applications such as the MS Office Suite, Outlook etc. Clients who only create electronic records using authoring applications can be implemented as soon as the Operational Platform is ready. Enterprise services provide the actual integration of GCDOCS operational services with departmental applications and services that create or manage unstructured records.\n",

      "To date, committed multi-year funding has not been available to the project. To accommodate this, the project will work on a regime of fiscal year plans that will be a subset of the master plan. This will require that each year, the project submit a funding proposal for work to be accomplished in the relevant year. It is anticipated the project will take at least 5 years to complete given historic funding levels. The work plans have laid out the entire scope of all that needs to be done to implement GCDOCS department-wide. The work plans themselves have been set up to allow filtering of tasks based on a number of criteria. As part of the operational planning process at the start of each fiscal year, the Project Manager will prioritize the remaining tasks in the work plan based on budget expectations and select a subset of activities to form the funding submission for the year.\n",

      "5.3.1 Managing Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the size of the IM project in general, the approach will be to define a series of sub-projects, with a general duration of no more than two years. Charters will be developed at the sub-project level. This will align more closely with the realities of the department. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sub-projects can run concurrently if there are sufficient resources available to do so. Unless multi-year funding is obtained, each sub-project will prepare an annual funding submission and plan as part of the corporate governance process. As noted, there are currently three generic sub-projects defined: iRIMS Standardization, GCDOCS RM Implementation and GCDOCS DM Implementation. Given the size and effort required for GCDOCS DM implementation, it may be split into further sub-projects, potentially on a regional basis (i.e. treat DM implementation in each region as a sub-project). Components of each can also be bundled as a sub-project.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The IMB Executive provides day-to-day monitoring and operational direction to the project. It consists of the CIO, IMB Executive, and the Project Sponsor.\n",
      "2. The Steering Committee is composed of representative stakeholders in the client and partner realms. Membership in the client area changes as implementation proceeds.\n",
      "3. IM / IT Governance covers the various committees established within the department to monitor and define IT standards and practices. It provides direction in the areas of technology choices.\n",
      "4. Corporate governance makes investment decisions and sets departmental priorities.  \n",
      "5.4.2 External Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "External governance provides the framework for direction and decision to align departmental initiatives with the government as a whole. There are two main interfaces:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Treasury Board of Canada has several broad governance facets:\n",
      "a. It defines IT and IM policy and standards for the government as a whole. The project will ensure that IM Policy and directives requirements are incorporated into the GCDOCS solution.\n",
      "b. It defines the project management framework for the government as a whole. The project will adopt the framework elements defined by TB.\n",
      "c. It is the approval / monitoring body for major departmental initiatives. Project approval is obtained through the departmental Investment Plan, PCRA and OPMCA submission to Treasury Board. \n",
      "2. Shared Services Canada hosts all network and servers for the government as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interface to external governance is done through the appropriate internal governance mechanism. The corporate governance model manages the interface to Treasury Board and the Branch IM / IT Governance model manages the interface to Shared Services Canada,\n",

Where possible the superstructure will also come per-configured with a file plan. Superstructure can be developed by function, organization or community of practice. The idea is to achieve an 80% coverage rule i.e. the superstructure meets 80% of any particular business units needs with the remaining 20% to be addressed as custom tailoring at the time of implementation.
