      "1. This report contains the product of the Electronic Communications Policy (ECP) Group. The Group was established in August 1999 at the request of the Chairman and President of CPSR to develop a CPSR EC Policy and Net etiquette (\"netiquette\") guidelines. In addition to this Executive Summary, the report consists of: i) Proposals for a CPSR Electronic Communications Policy (ECP) (Attachment 1); ii) Proposed organizational arrangements for ECP implementation (Attachment 2); iii) FAQ explaining the need for an ECP (Attachment 3) and iv) Voluntary \"Netiquette\" guidelines (Attachment 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. CPSR's Electronic communications Policy (ECP) defines rules of usage for employees, volunteers, members, and non-members of CPSR-owned or -sponsored electronic communications facilities. The terms \"electronic communications facilities\" includes servers which host CPSR systems, email communication systems, websites, discussion lists, chat rooms, telephone, voicemail and facsimile systems, computers, modems, and other technology that may be used for electronic communications. The core of the ECP is the following Mandatory Policy Provisions (See Attachment 1 for details). CPSR:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* a. does not, as a policy, monitor the electronic communications of individuals except insofar as they take place on CPSR lists and in established CPSR groups. However, as CPSR is legally accountable for its facilities, it is the owner of information generated through its facilities, some of which constitute official program/administrative records.\n",
      "* b. does not and cannot guarantee that communications over its facilities will remain inviolate from observation by persons not intended to receive them.\n",
      "* c. communications facilities are for the conduct of CPSR program activities and business. They may not be used to download, post or otherwise illegally distribute information that violates intellectual property rights or other laws, nor may they be used for proselytizing religious or political organizations or for advancing commercial interests without prior written CPSR approval. They may not be used to send \"flaming,\" harassing, libelous, slanderous, threatening, sexually explicit, obscene or pornographic representations or depictions, or ethnic or religious slurs. The only exception to this rule is in the case of a Board-sanctioned program activity of civil disobedience (e.g. anonymous communication, \"indecent\" speech, parody speech, or encrypted communication).\n",
      "* d. does not sell, rent or otherwise share email addresses or other personally identifiable information about its members; nor does it collect information about viewers of its website.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Violations of ECP may result in disciplinary measures, including removal from membership and/or use of facilities and, for employees, possible dismissal and termination of benefits. Organizational arrangements for administering violations of mandatory policy provisions are covered in Attachment 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Implementation of EC Policy is currently the domain of the Publications Committee, which is already charged with handling the content of the web site, or another Board-designated body.

      "Why Create a Taxonomy?\n",
      "The information is there. The challenge is to help executives, analysts, sales managers, support staff, and customers find and use the right information efficiently and effectively. Many enterprises extract value from the business information they accumulate by organizing the data logically and consistently into categories and subcategories, creating a taxonomy. When information is structured and indexed in a taxonomy, users can find what they need by working down tomore specific categories, up to a more inclusive topic, or sideways to related topics. This article discusses taxonomies: what they are, how they are used, and the enterprise software used to manage them.\n",
      "Taxonomies for the Business Enterprise\n",
      "Enterprises collect enormous quantities of information that can significantly improve all aspects of a business, from forecasting and decision making to sales and customer service.\n",
      "These benefits can be realized, however, only if people are able to find and make sense of the right information when it is needed. Both customers and employees can better access and use needed information when it is organized into categories and subcategories within a taxonomy. A taxonomy can also improve search results by showing the levels immediately above, below, and adjacent to the search term in the hierarchy, providing both a meaningful context and ideas for further exploration. Some taxonomies also list synonyms or preferred terms and automatically expand searches to include equivalent terms\n",
      "Multiple independent taxonomies, or facets, can be overlaid to provide different views into the same data. For example, a database of music could have separate facets organized by genre, year created, ethnicity, and record label. Facets also allow information to be labeled and organized differently for various groups, such as customers, sales staff, support staff, and scientists.\n",
      "Several tasks are involved in maintaining a taxonomy of business information. A business must first determine a suitable structure for the data it has or will accumulate, and then assign each piece of content a place in the structure. To help users make the best use of this information, the taxonomy must then be integrated with other business systems. Continued maintenance will also be necessary, both updating the taxonomy to keep it relevant, and classifying new information as it is added.\n",
      "Many businesses do not catalog their data consistently, either because the process is too time-consuming or because more immediately urgent tasks intervene. And even when a business does address this issue, it can be difficult to ensure that all the data is included and categorized consistently across business units, in a way that will be logical and understandable to its intended users.\n",
      "Taxonomy management software can be used to reduce the time, labor, and potential inconsistencies involved in creating, implementing, and maintaining a taxonomy. With such software, a business can import, convert, merge, and modify existing taxonomies, and also automatically generate taxonomies to custom-fit its data. Taxonomy software can analyze a text and automatically assign it to a place in the taxonomy, with the option for users to manually override or modify the resulting classification. Taxonomy software can also integrate with or send output to content management, portal, and other enterprise management systems. It can even streamline workflow within a business by enabling automatic routing and responding for documents, emails, and customer interactions, based on their content or other characteristics. Taxonomy management software today is increasing in power and complexity.\n",
      "Taxonomies Make Information Accessible\n",
      "Just as a library would be of little use if it failed to organize and catalog its books, so accumulated business information provides little value to an enterprise unless it is organized into a logical, consistent framework for retrieval or analysis. Poor information management also reduces productivity. As was shown by several independent studies summarized by KMWorld magazine (www.kmworld.com):\n",
      "* Knowledge workers spend 15 to 35 percent of their time searching for information\n",
      "* 40 percent cannot find the information they need on their corporate intranets\n",
      "* 15 percent of their time is spent duplicating information that exists but cannot be found\n",
      "A taxonomy is a good way to make accumulated information accessible and usable. When information is organized and indexed in a taxonomy, users can find what they need by starting with a general topic at a high level, and then drilling down through subcategories to find more specialized information. They can also use the taxonomy to explore by moving from a specific topic up to a more inclusive topic, or sideways to related topics, even if they are not sure what they are looking for.\n",
      "In addition, a taxonomy makes searching for information easier and more effective because search results can show the levels immediately above, below, and adjacent to the search term in the hierarchy, providing context as well as ideas for further exploration. Some taxonomies use a numerical index that is shorter and easier to work with. The Dewey Decimal and U.S. Library of Congress systems are examples of numerically indexed taxonomies.\n",
      "Getting Started with a Business Taxonomy\n",
      "Several tasks are involved in creating, applying, and maintaining a taxonomy of business information. A business must first create the taxonomy framework by determining a suitable structure for the data it has accumulated or will accumulate. This structure should capture the relationships inherent in the body of information in an intuitive way, as well as reflecting how the information fits into the overall structure of the business. The taxonomy framework will then need to be updated regularly to remain relevant and useful as new information is incorporated and as changes occur in terminology, technology, and markets.\n",
      "Once the categories have been determined, a business must populate the taxonomy by assigning each piece of content a place where it belongs. After an initial large-scale classification or reclassification of existing content, there will be an ongoing need to classify each new piece of information. Classification can be immensely time-consuming, not only because of the ever-increasing volumes of information to be catalogued, but also because of difficult and possibly controversial decisions concerning where to place items that could go in more than one category.\n",
      "Once a taxonomy is created and populated, it must be integrated into the business, to improve users' ability to find and make sense of the information they need. This often includes helping them find the right information when they are not sure what they are looking for, and perhaps are not aware of what information is available. Another benefit of a well-designed taxonomy is to help users be confident, when a search fails, that the looked-for information is really not there, so they can look elsewhere instead of continuing a fruitless search.\n",
      "Enterprise Taxonomy Management Software\n",
      "To reduce the time expenditure and improve the consistency of their information management and classification processes, many business use taxonomy management software, which can help with creating, implementing, and maintaining taxonomies. While vendors label their products by different names - including business semantics modeling, knowledge organization system, controlled vocabulary, thesaurus, ontology, and metadata model - they have enough similarity to all be categorized as enterprise taxonomy management software. Table 1 lists some vendors of this software genre, along with their products.\n",

      "Importing Existing Taxonomies\n",
      "Most taxonomy management software allows users to import, convert, and modify existing taxonomies. These could be from databases or classifications that a company already maintains, or published third-party taxonomies, which can be found for many business, medical, scientific, engineering, and public policy topic areas. Often the vendor of the taxonomy management software includes or makes available a selection of predefined taxonomies, which can then be synchronized to create a single enterprise-wide taxonomy. Once the data have been imported and converted, responsibility for subsets of the taxonomy can be distributed to relevant subject matter experts within the company for further customization.\n",
      "Automatic Taxonomy Generation\n",
      "Some software automatically generates a taxonomy by using natural language processing and statistical clustering to analyze the topics and subtopics found in a company's documents, without human analysis. For example, Wordmap offers text mining and automated categorization tools. Taxonomy software can also review existing categorized content and suggest new categories to be added. The suggested taxonomy may then be manually adjusted, but beginning with automatic generation can provide a big head start on the process.\n",
      "Automatic Classification\n",
      "Once a taxonomy has been created, taxonomy software can use natural language processing, semantic analysis, and statistical pattern matching to analyze each body of text, and then assign it to a place in the taxonomy by attaching a metadata tag. An option is always provided to override or modify the resulting classification, and problematic documents are automatically set aside for manual classification.\n",
      "Integration and Application of Taxonomy Software\n",
      "Taxonomy software can be either a standalone system or a module of a complete information storage and retrieval system. Most standalone systems can integrate with or send output to content management, portal, and other enterprise management systems. Storing the taxonomy shell, or definition, separately from the content allows various applications and groups to share it.\n",
      "Maintenance of the Taxonomy and Database\n",
      "Taxonomies require regular maintenance in order to remain relevant and up-to-date. New content must be incorporated into existing or new categories. To keep the taxonomy current in terminology and associations, subject matter experts within the company can be assigned responsibility and security authorization to maintain the sections where they have expertise. To help maintain internal consistency, the software can automatically update the other half of a reciprocal relationship when a change, addition, or deletion occurs. Reports and graphical representations of hierarchies and maps (with drag and drop interfaces) can also aid taxonomy maintenance. For example, reports can show broken links, linkless nodes, and who made what changes.\n",
      "The Business Case for a Taxonomy\n",
      "New technology is constantly being developed to help users manage and make sense of their vast and increasing information resources. Taxonomy management software in particular is becoming more powerful as it gains the ability to represent the complex, specific relationships of a thesaurus or ontology.\n",
      "There is no question that a business must keep its information organized and accessible; however, implementing a software-based taxonomy management system may not be appropriate in every case. A taxonomy is, after all, really nothing more than a filing system. And some businesses may be functioning well enough with their current filing methods and not benefit enough from a taxonomy management system to justify the cost of implementation. Nevertheless, given the accelerated pace at which information currently accumulates, most companies would benefit from implementing at least a basic electronic taxonomy.\n",
      "Implementing a taxonomy can improve the navigation of a company's website and help customers find product information faster and more reliably, leading to increased sales and better customer relations. A Forrester research report found that \"poorly architected retailing sites\" sell only half as much as better sites. And it is very important to help users find information on the first try: in one study of users whose searches failed, 47 percent gave up after just one search, and only 23 percent tried three or more times. Another study of e-commerce sites showed that users find desired information only 34 percent of the time with a simple search, but 54 percent of the time using a taxonomy.\n",
      "Internally, a taxonomy can improve productivity and customer service by helping employees find information faster and more reliably. By establishing a common terminology and structure, a taxonomy can also improve communication among various employee groups, as well as with customers. Finally, the taxonomy can itself become a valuable resource representing the company's accumulated knowledge.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the efficiency gains from a taxonomy management system can in some situations be offset by its labor-intensive setup. If a business does decide to implement a taxonomy management system, it should not underestimate the effort that will be involved in creating and maintaining a taxonomy. A system that offers labor-saving options such as importing existing taxonomies, and automatic taxonomy creation and document classification, may be worth paying for. And even if only a simple taxonomy is currently needed, it would be wise to choose a system that has the flexibility to grow with the business, and that will be compatible over time with the trend toward richer representations such as ontologies and topic maps.\n",

      "Deep learningis a subset ofmachine learningthat focuses on utilizing multilayeredneural networksto perform tasks such asclassification,regression, andrepresentation learning. The field takes inspiration frombiological neuroscienceand is centered around stackingartificial neuronsinto layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can besupervised,semi-supervisedorunsupervised.[2]\n",
      "Some common deep learning network architectures includefully connected networks,deep belief networks,recurrent neural networks,convolutional neural networks,generative adversarial networks,transformers, andneural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,natural language processing,machine translation,bioinformatics,drug design,medical image analysis,climate science, material inspection andboard gameprograms, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]\n",
      "Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes inbiological systems, particularly thehuman brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.[6]\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layeredneural networkssuch asconvolutional neural networksandtransformers, although they can also includepropositional formulasor latent variables organized layer-wise in deepgenerative modelssuch as the nodes indeep belief networksand deepBoltzmann machines.[7]\n",
      "Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class ofmachine learningalgorithmsin which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in animage recognitionmodel, the raw input may be animage(represented as atensorofpixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\n",
      "Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which levelon its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-craftedfeature engineeringto transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the modeldiscoversuseful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.[8][2]\n",
      "The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantialcredit assignment path(CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For afeedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). Forrecurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.[9]No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.[10]Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.\n",
      "Deep learning architectures can be constructed with agreedylayer-by-layer method.[11]Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.[8]\n",
      "Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner aredeep belief networks.[8][12]\n",
      "The termdeep learningwas introduced to the machine learning community byRina Dechterin 1986,[13]and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context ofBooleanthreshold neurons.[14][15]Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.[16]\n",
      "Interpretations\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of theuniversal approximation theorem[17][18][19][20][21]orprobabilistic inference.[22][23][8][9][24]\n",
      "The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity offeedforward neural networkswith a single hidden layer of finite size to approximatecontinuous functions.[17][18][19][20]In 1989, the first proof was published byGeorge Cybenkoforsigmoidactivation functions[17]and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.[18]Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such asKunihiko Fukushima'srectified linear unit.[25][26]\n",
      "The universal approximation theorem fordeep neural networksconcerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al.[21]proved that if the width of a deep neural network withReLUactivation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate anyLebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.\n",
      "Theprobabilisticinterpretation[24]derives from the field ofmachine learning. It features inference,[23][7][8][9][12][24]as well as theoptimizationconcepts oftrainingandtesting, related to fitting andgeneralization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as acumulative distribution function.[24]The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction ofdropoutasregularizerin neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers includingHopfield,WidrowandNarendraand popularized in surveys such as the one byBishop.[27]\n",

      "[edit]\n",
      "There are twotypesof artificial neural network (ANN):feedforward neural network(FNN) ormultilayer perceptron(MLP) andrecurrent neural networks(RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s,Wilhelm LenzandErnst Isingcreated theIsing model[28][29]which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972,Shun'ichi Amarimade this architecture adaptive.[30][31]His learning RNN was republished byJohn Hopfieldin 1982.[32]Other earlyrecurrent neural networkswere published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971.[33][34]Already in 1948,Alan Turingproduced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime,[35]containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\".[31]\n",
      "Frank Rosenblatt(1958)[36]proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight).[37]:?section 16?The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960)[38]\"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptivemultilayer perceptronswith learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion.\n",
      "The first working deep learning algorithm was theGroup method of data handling, a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published byAlexey Ivakhnenkoand Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression,[39]or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron.[40]A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method,[41]which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\".[31]\n",
      "The first deep learningmultilayer perceptrontrained bystochastic gradient descent[42]was published in 1967 byShun'ichi Amari.[43]In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learnedinternal representationsto classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.[31]Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-endstochastic gradient descentthe currently dominant training technique.\n",
      "In 1969,Kunihiko Fukushimaintroduced theReLU(rectified linear unit)activation function.[25][31]The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning.[44]\n",
      "Deep learning architectures forconvolutional neural networks(CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with theNeocognitronintroduced byKunihiko Fukushimain 1979, though not trained by backpropagation.[45][46]\n",
      "Backpropagationis an efficient application of thechain rulederived byGottfried Wilhelm Leibnizin 1673[47]to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt,[37]but he did not know how to implement this, althoughHenry J. Kelleyhad a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context ofcontrol theory.[48]The modern form of backpropagation was first published inSeppo Linnainmaa's master thesis (1970).[49][50][31]G.M. Ostrovski et al. republished it in 1971.[51][52]Paul Werbosapplied backpropagation to neural networks in 1982[53](his 1974 PhD thesis, reprinted in a 1994 book,[54]did not yet describe the algorithm[52]). In 1986,David E. Rumelhartet al. popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work.[55][56]\n",
      "1980s-2000s\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Thetime delay neural network(TDNN) was introduced in 1987 byAlex Waibelto apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation.[57][58]In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition.[59]In 1989,Yann LeCunet al. created a CNN calledLeNetforrecognizing handwritten ZIP codeson mail. Training required 3 days.[60]In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN onoptical computinghardware.[61]In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation[62]and breast cancer detection in mammograms.[63]LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN byYann LeCunet al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images.[64]\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks(RNN)[28][30]were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were theJordan network(1986)[65]and theElman network(1990),[66]which applied RNN to study problems incognitive psychology.\n",
      "In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991,Jrgen Schmidhuberproposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time byself-supervised learningwhere each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below.[67][68]This \"neural history compressor\" usespredictive codingto learninternal representationsat multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can becollapsedinto a single RNN, bydistillinga higher levelchunkernetwork into a lower levelautomatizernetwork.[67][68][31]In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequentlayersin an RNN unfolded in time.[69]The \"P\" inChatGPTrefers to such pre-training.\n",
      "Sepp Hochreiter's diploma thesis (1991)[70]implemented the neural history compressor,[67]and identified and analyzed thevanishing gradient problem.[70][71]Hochreiter proposed recurrentresidualconnections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to thelong short-term memory(LSTM), published in 1995.[72]LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks[9]with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999,[73]which became the standard RNN architecture.\n",
      "In 1991,Jrgen Schmidhuberalso published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of azero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss.[74][75]The first network is agenerative modelthat models aprobability distributionover output patterns. The second network learns bygradient descentto predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used ingenerative adversarial networks(GANs).[76]\n",
      "During 19851995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed byTerry Sejnowski,Peter Dayan,Geoffrey Hinton, etc., including theBoltzmann machine,[77]restricted Boltzmann machine,[78]Helmholtz machine,[79]and thewake-sleep algorithm.[80]These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p.112[81]). A 1988 network became state of the art inprotein structure prediction, an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics.[82]\n",
      "Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs forspeech recognitionhave been explored for many years.[83][84][85]These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussianmixture model/Hidden Markov model(GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.[86]Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing[70]and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[87][88]Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.\n",

      "The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[104]The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[105]offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.[23][106][107]Analysis around 20092010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition.[105]That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.[104][105][108]In 2010, researchers extended deep learning fromTIMITto large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed bydecision trees.[109][110][111][106]\n",

These weak signals may result in afalse positiveresult for sea urchin.\n",

      "Artificial neural networks(ANNs) orconnectionistsystemsare computing systems inspired by thebiological neural networksthat constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manuallylabeledas \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm usingrule-based programming.\n",
      "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units calledartificial neurons, (analogous to biologicalneuronsin abiological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented byreal numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.\n",
      "Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
      "The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such asbackpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.\n",
      "Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision,speech recognition,machine translation,social networkfiltering,playing board and video gamesand medical diagnosis.\n",
      "As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections.

      "A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers.[7][9]There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[145]These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.[citation needed]\n",
      "For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer,[146]and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks.\n",
      "DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition ofprimitives.[147]The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.[7]For instance, it was proved that sparsemultivariate polynomialsare exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.[148]\n",
      "Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.[146]\n",
      "DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.[149]That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks, in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such aslanguage modeling.[150][151][152][153][154]Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.[155][156]\n",

      "As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues areoverfittingand computation time.\n",
      "DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data.Regularizationmethods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning[41]orweight decay(?2-regularization) orsparsity(?1-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.[159]Alternativelydropoutregularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies.[160]Another interesting recent development is research into models of just enough complexity through an estimation of the intrinsic complexity of the task being modelled. This approach has been successfully applied for multivariate time series prediction tasks such as traffic prediction.[161]Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.[162]\n",
      "DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), thelearning rate, and initial weights.Sweeping through the parameter spacefor optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such asbatching(computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)[163]speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.[164][165]\n",
      "Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.[166][167]\n",

      "Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of astochastic processand called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE).[229]Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of inputrandom variableson an independentrandom variable. Practically, the DNN is trained as aclassifierthat maps an inputvectorormatrixX to an outputprobability distributionover the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, inimage classificationtasks, the NJEE maps a vector ofpixels' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by aSoftmaxlayer with number of nodes that is equal to thealphabetsize of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiableactivation functions, such that the conditions for theuniversal approximation theoremholds. It is shown that this method provides a stronglyconsistent estimatorand outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes.[229]\n",

      "In November 2023, researchers atGoogle DeepMindandLawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryannounced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed tomaterials scienceby discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganiccrystal structures. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through theMaterials Projectdatabase, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.[239][240][241]\n",

      "Deep backward stochastic differential equation method\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Deep backward stochastic differential equation methodis a numerical method that combines deep learning withBackward stochastic differential equation(BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities ofdeep neural networks, deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden.[246]\n",
      "In addition, the integration ofPhysics-informed neural networks(PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems.\n",

      "Relation to human cognitive and brain development\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories ofbrain development(specifically, neocortical development) proposed bycognitive neuroscientistsin the early 1990s.[252][253][254][255]These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave ofnerve growth factor) support theself-organizationsomewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like theneocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack oftransducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\".[256]\n",
      "A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of thebackpropagationalgorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism.[257][258]Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchicalgenerative modelsanddeep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality.[259][260]In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.[261]\n",
      "Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons[262]and neural populations.[263]Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system[264]both at the single-unit[265]and at the population[266]levels.\n",

      "In 2017, Covariant.ai was launched, which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories.[271]\n",
      "As of 2008,[272]researchers atThe University of Texas at Austin(UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor.[242]First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration betweenU.S. Army Research Laboratory(ARL) and UT researchers. Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation.[242]Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as \"good job\" and \"bad job\".[273]\n",

      "A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.[274]Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear.[citation needed](e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as ablack box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.[275]\n",
      "In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained[276]demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article onThe Guardian's[277]website.\n",

      "Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors,[278]such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014)[279]and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013).[280]Goertzelhypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-componentartificial general intelligence(AGI) architectures.[278]These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar[281]decompositions of observed entities and events.[278]Learning a grammar(visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system tocommonsense reasoningthat operates on concepts in terms of grammaticalproduction rulesand is a basic goal of both human language acquisition[282]andartificial intelligence(AI).[283]\n",
      "Cyber threat\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.[284]By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an \"adversarial attack\".[285]\n",
      "In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system.[286]One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such asTinEyethat can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.[287]\n",
      "Another group showed that certainpsychedelicspectacles could fool afacial recognition systeminto thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers tostop signsand caused an ANN to misclassify them.[286]\n",
      "ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts atdeception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines themalwaredefense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malwaresoftware by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by agenetic algorithmuntil it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.[286]\n",
      "In 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make theGoogle Nowvoice command system open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could \"serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)\".[286]\n",

      "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to model and solve complex problemsespecially those involving unstructured data like images, audio, and natural language.\n",
      "Core Idea\n",
      "At its heart, deep learning mimics how the human brain processes information. It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence deep) to automatically learn features and patterns from raw data.\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "1. Input Layer  Takes in raw data (like pixels from an image).\n",
      "2. Hidden Layers  Each layer extracts increasingly abstract features. For example, in image recognition:\n",
      "o Layer 1 might detect edges\n",
      "o Layer 2 might detect shapes\n",
      "o Layer 3 might detect objects like eyes or wheels\n",
      "3. Output Layer  Produces the final prediction or classification.\n",
      "The model learns by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons using algorithms like backpropagation and gradient descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Architectures\n",
      "* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  Great for image and video analysis.\n",
      "* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  Designed for sequential data like time series or language.\n",
      "* Transformers  Powerhouses behind modern language models like GPT and BERT.\n",
      "* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  Used for generating new data (like deepfakes or art).\n",

      "Lets break it downbecause these terms often get tossed around like interchangeable buzzwords, but theyre actually quite distinct:\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
      "AI is the broadest concept. It refers to machines designed to simulate human intelligencethings like reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and even creativity. AI includes everything from rule-based systems to advanced neural networks.\n",
      "Think of AI as the umbrella under which everything else falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine Learning (ML)\n",
      "ML is a subset of AI. It focuses on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.\n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
      "LLMs are a specific type of machine learning model, typically based on deep learning and trained on massive amounts of text data. Theyre designed to understand and generate human-like language.\n",
      "Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. These models can:\n",
      "* Write essays\n",
      "* Translate languages\n",
      "* Summarize documents\n",

      "Artificial intelligence then machine learning then deep learning then large language models\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you explain the underlying principles of large language models?\n",
      "Absolutely! Large Language Models (LLMs) like me are built on a fascinating blend of mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. Heres a breakdown of the core principles that make them tick:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Neural Network Architecture\n",
      "At the heart of LLMs is a type of deep learning model called a transformer. This architecture uses layers of artificial neurons to process and generate language. The key innovation is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentenceregardless of their position.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Training on Massive Text Corpora\n",
      "LLMs are trained on huge datasetsbooks, websites, articles, and more. This training is typically self-supervised, meaning the model learns to predict missing words or next words in a sentence without needing labeled data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Tokenization\n",
      "Before training, text is broken down into tokenswhich can be words, subwords, or even characters. The model learns patterns in these tokens and how they relate to one another across contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Probability and Prediction\n",
      "LLMs are essentially probability machines. Given a sequence of tokens, they calculate the most likely next token. This is how they generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Representation Learning\n",
      "During training, the model builds internal representations of languagecapturing grammar, facts, reasoning patterns, and even some world knowledge. These representations are stored in the models parameters (which can number in the billions or trillions).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Fine-Tuning and Alignment\n",
      "After pretraining, LLMs can be fine-tuned on specific tasks (like summarization or coding) or aligned with human values using techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Generalization\n",
      "One of the most powerful aspects of LLMs is their ability to generalizeto apply what theyve learned to new, unseen prompts. This is what allows them to answer questions, write poetry, or help with coding.\n",

      "Identity and access management\n",
      "Identity and access management(IAMorIdAM) orIdentity management(IdM), is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users (that are part of theecosystemconnected to or within an enterprise) have the appropriate access to technology resources. IAM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas ofIT securityanddata management. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate, and control access for individuals who will be utilizing IT resources but also the hardware and applications employees need to access.[1]\n",
      "The terms \"identity management\" (IdM) and \"identity and access management\" are used interchangeably in the area of identity access management.[2]\n",
      "Identity-management systems, products, applications and platforms manage identifying and ancillary data about entities that include individuals, computer-related hardware, andsoftware applications.\n",
      "IdM covers issues such as how users gain anidentity, the roles, and sometimes the permissions that identity grants, the protection of that identity, and the technologies supporting that protection (e.g.,network protocols,digital certificates,passwords, etc.).\n",
      "Definitions\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Identity management (ID management)  or identity and access management (IAM)  is the organizational and technical processes for first registering and authorizing access rights in the configuration phase, and then in the operation phase for identifying, authenticating and controlling individuals or groups of people to have access to applications, systems or networks based on previously authorized access rights. Identity management (IdM) is the task of controlling information about users on computers. Such information includes information thatauthenticatesthe identity of a user, and information that describes data and actions they areauthorizedto access and/or perform. It also includes the management of descriptive information about the user and how and by whom that information can be accessed and modified. In addition to users, managed entities typically include hardware and network resources and even applications.[3]The diagram below shows the relationship between the configuration and operation phases of IAM, as well as the distinction between identity management and access management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access controlis the enforcement of access rights defined as part ofaccess authorization.\n",
      "Digital identityis an entity's online presence, encompassing personal identifying information (PII) and ancillary information. SeeOECD[4]andNIST[5]guidelines on protecting PII.[6]It can be interpreted as the codification of identity names and attributes of a physical instance in a way that facilitates processing.\n",
      "Function\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In the real-world context of engineering online systems, identity management can involve five basic functions:\n",
      "* Pure identity function: Creation, management and deletion of identities without regard to access or entitlements\n",
      "* User access (log-on) function: For example, asmart cardand its associated data used by a customer to log on to a service or services (a traditional view)\n",
      "* Service function: A system that delivers personalized, role-based, online, on-demand, multimedia (content), presence-based services to users and their devices\n",
      "* Identity federation: A system that relies onfederated identityto authenticate a user without knowing their password\n",
      "* Audit function: Monitors bottlenecks, malfunctions and suspect behaviors\n",
      "Pure identity\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A general model ofidentitycan be constructed from a small set of axioms, for example that all identities in a givennamespaceare unique, or that such identities bear a specific relationship to corresponding entities in the real world. Such an axiomatic model expresses \"pure identity\" in the sense that the model is not constrained by a specific application context.\n",
      "In general, an entity (real or virtual) can have multiple identities and each identity can encompass multiple attributes, some of which are unique within a given name space. The diagram below illustrates the conceptual relationship between identities and entities, as well as between identities and their attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most theoretical and all practical models ofdigital identity, a given identity object consists of a finite set ofproperties(attribute values). These properties record information about the object, either for purposes external to the model or to operate the model, for example in classification and retrieval. A \"pure identity\" model is strictly not concerned with the externalsemanticsof these properties.\n",
      "The most common departure from \"pure identity\" in practice occurs with properties intended to assure some aspect of identity, for example adigital signatureorsoftware tokenwhich the model may use internally to verify some aspect of the identity in satisfaction of an external purpose. To the extent that the model expresses such semantics internally, it is not a pure model.\n",
      "Contrast this situation with properties that might be externally used for purposes ofinformation securitysuch as managing access or entitlement, but which are simply stored, maintained and retrieved, without special treatment by the model. The absence of external semantics within the model qualifies it as a \"pure identity\" model.\n",
      "Identity management can thus be defined as a set of operations on a given identity model, or more generally, as a set of capabilities with reference to it.\n",
      "In practice, identity management often expands to express how model content is to beprovisionedandreconciledamong multiple identity models. The process of reconciling accounts may also be referred to as de-provisioning.[7]\n",
      "User access\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "User access enables users to assume a specific digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and users. It simplifies access monitoring and verification and allows the organizations to minimize excessive privileges granted to one user. Ensuring user access security is crucial in this process, as it involves protecting the integrity and confidentiality of user credentials and preventing unauthorized access. Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular security audits, and strict access controls, helps safeguard user identities and sensitive data. User access can be tracked from initiation to termination of user access.\n",
      "When organizations deploy an identity management process or system, their motivation is normally not primarily to manage a set of identities, but rather to grant appropriate access rights to those entities via their identities. In other words, access management is normally the motivation for identity management and the two sets of processes are consequently closely related.[8]\n",
      "Services\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Organizations continue to add services for both internal users and by customers. Many such services require identity management to properly provide these services. Increasingly, identity management has been partitioned from application functions so that a single identity can serve many or even all of an organization's activities.[8]\n",
      "For internal use identity management is evolving to control access to all digital assets, including devices, network equipment, servers, portals, content, applications and/or products.\n",
      "Services often require access to extensive information about a user, including address books, preferences, entitlements and contact information. Since much of this information is subject to privacy and/or confidentiality requirements, controlling access to it is vital.[9]\n",
      "Identity federation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Federated identity\n",
      "Identity federation comprises one or more systems that share user access and allow users to log in based on authenticating against one of the systems participating in the federation. This trust between several systems is often known as a \"circle of trust\". In this setup, one system acts as theidentity provider(IdP) and other systems act asservice providers(SPs). When a user needs to access some service controlled by SP, they first authenticate against the IdP. Upon successful authentication, the IdP sends a secure \"assertion\" to the SP. \"SAML assertions, specified using a markup language intended for describing security assertions, can be used by a verifier to make a statement to a relying party about the identity of a claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.\"[10]\n",
      "System capabilities\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In addition to creation, deletion, modification of user identity data either assisted or self-service, identity management controls ancillary entity data for use by applications, such as contact information or location.\n",
      "* Authentication: Verification that an entity is who/what it claims to be using a password, biometrics such as a fingerprint, or distinctive behavior such as a gesture pattern on a touchscreen.\n",
      "* Authorization: Managing authorization information that defines what operations an entity can perform in the context of a specific application. For example, one user might be authorized to enter a sales order, while a different user is authorized to approve the credit request for that order.\n",
      "* Roles: Roles are groups of operations and/or other roles. Users are granted roles often related to a particular job or job function. Roles are granted authorizations, effectively authorizing all users which have been granted the role. For example, a user administrator role might be authorized to reset a user's password, while a system administrator role might have the ability to assign a user to a specific server.\n",
      "* Delegation: Delegation allows local administrators or supervisors to perform system modifications without a global administrator or for one user to allow another to perform actions on their behalf. For example, a user could delegate the right to manage office-related information.\n",
      "* Interchange: TheSAMLprotocolis a prominent means used to exchange identity information between two identity domains.[11]OpenID Connectis another such protocol.\n",
      "Privacy\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Putting personal information onto computer networks necessarily raisesprivacyconcerns. Absent proper protections, the data may be used to implement asurveillance society.[12]\n",
      "Social webandonline social networkingservices make heavy use of identity management. Helping users decide how to manage access to their personal information has become an issue of broad concern.[13][14]\n",
      "Research\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Research related to the management of identity covers disciplines such as technology, social sciences, humanities and the law.[15]\n",
      "Decentralized identity management is identity management based ondecentralized identifiers(DIDs).[16]\n",
      "European research\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Within theSeventh Research Framework Programmeof the European Union from 2007 to 2013, several new projects related to Identity Management started.\n",
      "The PICOS Project investigates and develops a state-of-the-art platform for providing trust, privacy and identity management in mobile communities.[17]\n",

      "Data Science\n",
      "Data scienceis aninterdisciplinaryacademic field[1]that usesstatistics,scientific computing,scientific methods, processing,scientific visualization,algorithmsand systems to extract or extrapolateknowledgefrom potentially noisy,structured, orunstructured data.[2]\n",
      "Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3]Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]\n",
      "Data science is \"a concept to unifystatistics,data analysis,informatics, and their relatedmethods\" to \"understand and analyze actualphenomena\" withdata.[5]It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context ofmathematics, statistics,computer science,information science, anddomain knowledge.[6]However, data science is different fromcomputer scienceand information science.Turing AwardwinnerJim Grayimagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical,theoretical,computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact ofinformation technology\" and thedata deluge.[7][8]\n",
      "Adata scientistis a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.[9]\n",
      "Foundations\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Data science is aninterdisciplinaryfield[10]focused onextracting knowledgefrom typicallylargedata setsand applying the knowledge from that data to solve problems in other application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems,analyzingdata, and summarizing these findings. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics,data visualization,graphic design,communication, andbusiness.[11]\n",
      "Vasant Dharwrites that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.[12]Andrew GelmanofColumbia Universityhas described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.[13]Stanford professorDavid Donohowrites that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.[14]\n",
      "Etymology\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Early usage\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In 1962,John Tukeydescribed a field he called \"data analysis\", which resembles modern data science.[14]In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing,C.F. Jeff Wuused the term \"data science\" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[15]Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at theUniversity of Montpellier IIacknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.[16][17]\n",
      "The term \"data science\" has been traced back to 1974, whenPeter Naurproposed it as an alternative name to computer science.[6]In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[6]However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997C.F. Jeff Wuagain suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.[18]In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.[17]\n",
      "Modern usage\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In 2012, technologistsThomas H. DavenportandDJ Patildeclared \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\",[19]a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like theNew York Times[20]and theBoston Globe.[21]A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".[22]\n",
      "The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed toWilliam S. Cleveland.[23]In 2014, theAmerican Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.[24]\n",
      "The professional title of \"data scientist\" has been attributed toDJ PatilandJeff Hammerbacherin 2008.[25]Though it was used by theNational Science Boardin their 2005 report \"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century\", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digitaldata collection.[26]\n",

      "[edit]\n",
      "Example for the usefulness ofexploratory data analysisas demonstrated using theDatasaurus dozendata setData science is at the intersection of mathematics,computer scienceanddomain expertise.\n",
      "Data analysis typically involves working with structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such asdata cleaninganddata visualizationto summarize data and develop hypotheses about relationships betweenvariables.Data analyststypically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data.[27]\n",
      "Data science involves working with larger datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work withunstructured datasuch as text or images and usemachine learningalgorithms to build predictive models. Data science often usesstatistical analysis,data preprocessing, andsupervised learning.[28][29]\n",

      "Cloud computingcan offer access to large amounts of computational power andstorage.[30]Inbig data, where volumes of information are continually generated and processed, these platforms can be used to handle complex and resource-intensive analytical tasks.[31]\n",
      "Some distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads. These frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel, which can reduce processing times.[32]\n",
      "Ethical consideration in data science\n",

The visual formats used in data visualization include charts and graphs (e.g.pie charts,bar charts,line charts,area charts,cone charts,pyramid charts,donut charts,histograms,spectrograms,cohort charts,waterfall charts,funnel charts,bullet graphs, etc.),diagrams,plots(e.g.scatter plots,distribution plots,box-and-whisker plots), geospatialmaps(such asproportional symbol maps,choropleth maps,isopleth mapsandheat maps), figures,correlation matrices, percentagegauges, etc., which sometimes can be combined in adashboard.\n",
      "Information visualization, on the other hand, deals with multiple, large-scale and complicated datasets which contain quantitative (numerical) data as well as qualitative (non-numerical, i.e. verbal or graphical) and primarily abstract information and its goal is to add value to raw data, improve the viewers' comprehension, reinforce their cognition and help them derive insights and make decisions as they navigate and interact with the computer-supported graphical display. Visual tools used in information visualization includemapsfor location based data;hierarchical[7]organisations of data such astree maps,radial_trees, and othertree_structures; displays that prioritiserelationships(Heer et al. 2010) such asSankey diagrams,network diagrams,venn diagrams,mind maps,semantic networks,entity-relationship diagrams;flow charts,timelines, etc.\n",
      "Emerging technologieslikevirtual,augmentedandmixed realityhave the potential to make information visualization more immersive, intuitive, interactive and easily manipulable and thus enhance the user'svisual perceptionandcognition.[8]In data and information visualization, the goal is to graphically present and explore abstract, non-physical and non-spatial data collected fromdatabases,information systems,file systems,documents,business data, etc. (presentational and exploratory visualization) which is different from the field ofscientific visualization, where the goal is to render realistic images based on physical andspatialscientific datato confirm or rejecthypotheses(confirmatory visualization).[9]\n",
      "Effective data visualization is properly sourced, contextualized, simple and uncluttered. The underlying data is accurate and up-to-date to make sure that insights are reliable. Graphical items are well-chosen for the given datasets and aesthetically appealing, with shapes, colors and other visual elements used deliberately in a meaningful and non-distracting manner. The visuals are accompanied by supporting texts (labels and titles). These verbal and graphical components complement each other to ensure clear, quick and memorable understanding. Effective information visualization is aware of the needs and concerns and the level of expertise of the target audience, deliberately guiding them to the intended conclusion.[10][3]Such effective visualization can be used not only for conveying specialized, complex, big data-driven ideas to a wider group of non-technical audience in a visually appealing, engaging and accessible manner, but also to domain experts and executives for making decisions, monitoring performance, generating new ideas and stimulating research.[10][4]In addition, data scientists, data analysts and data mining specialists use data visualization to check the quality of data, find errors, unusual gaps and missing values in data, clean data, explore the structures and features of data and assess outputs of data-driven models.[4]Inbusiness, data and information visualization can constitute a part ofdata storytelling, where they are paired with a coherentnarrativestructure orstorylineto contextualize the analyzed data and communicate the insights gained from analyzing the data clearly and memorably with the goal of convincing the audience into making a decision or taking an action in order to createbusiness value.[3][11]This can be contrasted with the field ofstatistical graphics, where complex statistical data are communicated graphically in an accurate and precise manner among researchers and analysts with statistical expertise to help them performexploratory data analysisor to convey the results of such analyses, where visual appeal, capturing attention to a certain issue and storytelling are not as important.[12]\n",
      "The field of data and information visualization is of interdisciplinary nature as it incorporates principles found in the disciplines ofdescriptive statistics(as early as the 18th century),[13]visual communication,graphic design,cognitive scienceand, more recently,interactive computer graphicsandhuman-computer interaction.[14]Since effective visualization requires design skills, statistical skills and computing skills, it is argued by authors such as Gershon and Page that it is both an art and a science.[15]The neighboring field ofvisual analyticsmarries statistical data analysis, data and information visualization and human analytical reasoning through interactive visual interfaces to help human users reach conclusions, gain actionable insights and make informed decisions which are otherwise difficult for computers to do.\n",
      "Research into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.[16][17]On the other hand, unintentionally poor or intentionally misleading and deceptive visualizations (misinformative visualization) can function as powerful tools which disseminatemisinformation, manipulate public perception and divertpublic opiniontoward a certain agenda.[18]Thus data visualization literacy has become an important component ofdataandinformation literacyin theinformation ageakin to the roles played bytextual,mathematicalandvisual literacyin the past.[19]\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Data visualization is one of the steps in analyzing data and presenting it to users.Partial map of the Internet early 2005 represented as a graph; each line represents twoIP addresses, and some delay between those two nodes.\n",
      "The field of data and information visualization has emerged \"from research inhumancomputer interaction,computer science,graphics,visual design,psychology,photographyandbusiness methods. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research,digital libraries,data mining, financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturingproduction control, anddrug discovery\".[20]\n",
      "Data and information visualization presumes that \"visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye's broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways.\"[21]\n",
      "Data analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.),statistics(hypothesis test,regression,PCA, etc.),data mining(association mining, etc.), andmachine learningmethods (clustering,classification,decision trees, etc.). Among these approaches, information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.\n",
      "To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization usesstatistical graphics,plots,information graphicsand other tools. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message.[22]Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence.[23]It makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable, but can also be reductive.[24]Users may have particular analytical tasks, such as making comparisons or understandingcausality, and the design principle of the graphic (i.e., showing comparisons or showing causality) follows the task. Tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement, while charts of various types are used to show patterns or relationships in the data for one or more variables.\n",
      "Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects (e.g., points, lines, or bars) contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps indata analysisordata science. According to Vitaly Friedman (2008) the \"main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose  to communicate information\".[25]\n",
      "Indeed,Fernanda ViegasandMartin M. Wattenbergsuggested that an ideal visualization should not only communicate clearly, but stimulate viewer engagement and attention.[26]\n",
      "Data visualization is closely related toinformation graphics,information visualization,scientific visualization,exploratory data analysisandstatistical graphics. In the new millennium, data visualization has become an active area of research, teaching and development. According to Post et al. (2002), it has united scientific and information visualization.[27]\n",

      "Characteristics of effective graphical displays\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.\n",
      "John Tukey[28]\n",
      "Edward Tuftehas explained that users of information displays are executing particularanalytical taskssuch as making comparisons. Thedesign principleof the information graphic should support the analytical task.[29]As William Cleveland and Robert McGill show, different graphical elements accomplish this more or less effectively. For example, dot plots and bar charts outperform pie charts.[30]\n",
      "In his 1983 bookThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information,[31]Edward Tuftedefines 'graphical displays' and principles for effective graphical display in the following passage: \"Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. Graphical displays should:\n",
      "* show the data\n",
      "* induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production, or something else\n",
      "* avoid distorting what the data has to say\n",
      "* present many numbers in a small space\n",
      "* make large data sets coherent\n",
      "* encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n",
      "* reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure\n",
      "* serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration\n",
      "* be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.\n",
      "Graphicsrevealdata. Indeed, graphics can be more precise and revealing than conventional statistical computations.\"[32]\n",
      "For example, the Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 18121813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, the direction of movement, and temperature. The line width illustrates a comparison (size of the army at points in time), while the temperature axis suggests a cause of the change in army size. This multivariate display on a two-dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility. Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"[32]\n",
      "Not applying these principles may result inmisleading graphs, distorting the message, or supporting an erroneous conclusion. According to Tufte,chartjunkrefers to the extraneous interior decoration of the graphic that does not enhance the message or gratuitous three-dimensional or perspective effects. Needlessly separating the explanatory key from the image itself, requiring the eye to travel back and forth from the image to the key, is a form of \"administrative debris.\" The ratio of \"data to ink\" should be maximized, erasing non-data ink where feasible.[32]\n",
      "TheCongressional Budget Officesummarized several best practices for graphical displays in a June 2014 presentation. These included: a) Knowing your audience; b) Designing graphics that can stand alone outside the report's context; and c) Designing graphics that communicate the key messages in the report.[33]\n",
      "Useful criteria for a data or information visualization include:[34]\n",
      "1. It is based on (non-visual) data - that is, a data/info viz is not image processing and collage;\n",
      "2. It creates an image - specifically that the image plays the primary role in communicating meaning and is not an illustration accompanying the data in text form; and\n",
      "3. The result is readable.\n",
      "Readability means that it is possible for a viewer to understand the underlying data, such as by making comparisons between proportionally sized visual elements to compare their respective data values; or using a legend to decode a map, like identifying coloured regions on a climate map to read temperature at that location. For greatest efficiency and simplicity of design and user experience, this readability is enhanced through the use of bijective mapping in that design of the image elements - where the mapping of representational element to data variable is unique.[35]\n",
      "Kosara (2007)[34]also identifies the need for a visualisation to be \"recognisable as a visualisation and not appear to be something else\". He also states that recognisability and readability may not always be required in all types of visualisation e.g. \"informative art\" (which would still meet all three above criteria but might not look like a visualisation) or \"artistic visualisation\" (which similarly is still based on non-visual data to create an image, but may not be readable or recognisable).\n",
      "Quantitative messages\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The same dataset plotted in three charts:Top panel is a bar chart depicting the flow of occurrences over time (resembles the Sankey diagram in theNew York Timesoriginal[36]). Middle panel is a bubble chart that separately quantifies discrete outcomes. Bottom panel is an exploded pie chart showing relative shares of categories, and shares within categories.\n",
      "AuthorStephen Fewdescribed eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message:\n",
      "1. Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate or temperature measures over a 10-year period. Aline chartmay be used to demonstrate the trend over time.\n",
      "2. Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (themeasure) by sales persons (thecategory, with each sales person acategorical subdivision) during a single period. Abar chartmay be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.\n",
      "3. Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%). Apie chartor bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.\n",
      "4. Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period. A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.\n",
      "5. Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 010%, 1120%, etc. Ahistogram, a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. Aboxplothelps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.\n",
      "6. Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. Ascatter plotis typically used for this message.\n",
      "7. Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.\n",
      "8. Geographicorgeospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. Acartogramis a typical graphic used.[22][37]\n",
      "Analysts reviewing a set of data may consider whether some or all of the messages and graphic types above are applicable to their task and audience. The process of trial and error to identify meaningful relationships and messages in the data is part ofexploratory data analysis.\n",
      "Visual perception and data visualization\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A human can distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) readily without significant processing effort; these are referred to as \"pre-attentive attributes\". For example, it may require significant time and effort (\"attentive processing\") to identify the number of times the digit \"5\" appears in a series of numbers; but if that digit is different in size, orientation, or color, instances of the digit can be noted quickly through pre-attentive processing.[38]\n",
      "Compelling graphics take advantage of pre-attentive processing and attributes and the relative strength of these attributes. For example, since humans can more easily process differences in line length than surface area, it may be more effective to use a bar chart (which takes advantage of line length to show comparison) rather than pie charts (which use surface area to show comparison).[38]\n",
      "Human perception/cognition and data visualization\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Almost all data visualizations are created for human consumption. Knowledge of human perception and cognition is necessary when designing intuitive visualizations.[39]Cognition refers to processes in human beings like perception, attention, learning, memory, thought, concept formation, reading, and problem solving.[40]Human visual processing is efficient in detecting changes and making comparisons between quantities, sizes, shapes and variations in lightness. When properties of symbolic data are mapped to visual properties, humans can browse through large amounts of data efficiently. It is estimated that 2/3 of the brain's neurons can be involved in visual processing. Proper visualization provides a different approach to show potential connections, relationships, etc. which are not as obvious in non-visualized quantitative data. Visualization can become a means ofdata exploration.\n",
      "Studies have shown individuals used on average 19% less cognitive resources, and 4.5% better able to recall details when comparing data visualization with text.[41]\n",

      "The modern study of visualization started withcomputer graphics, which \"has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization inScientific Computing. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by theIEEE Computer SocietyandACM SIGGRAPH\".[42]They have been devoted to the general topics ofdata visualization, information visualization andscientific visualization, and more specific areas such asvolume visualization. In 1786,William Playfairpublished the first presentation graphics.\n",

The product exports treemaps are one of the most recent applications of these kind of visualizations, developed by the Harvard-MITObservatory of Economic Complexity.\n",
      "There is no comprehensive 'history' of data visualization. There are no accounts that span the entire development of visual thinking and the visual representation of data, and which collate the contributions of disparate disciplines.[43]Michael Friendly and Daniel J Denis ofYork Universityare engaged in a project that attempts to provide a comprehensive history of visualization. Contrary to general belief, data visualization is not a modern development. Since prehistory, stellar data, or information such as location of stars were visualized on the walls of caves (such as those found inLascaux Cavein Southern France) since thePleistoceneera.[44]Physical artefacts such as Mesopotamianclay tokens(5500 BC), Incaquipus(2600 BC) and Marshall Islandsstick charts(n.d.) can also be considered as visualizing quantitative information.[45][46]\n",
      "The first documented data visualization can be tracked back to 1160 B.C. withTurin Papyrus Mapwhich accurately illustrates the distribution of geological resources and provides information about quarrying of those resources.[47]Such maps can be categorized asthematic cartography, which is a type of data visualization that presents and communicates specific data and information through a geographical illustration designed to show a particular theme connected with a specific geographic area. Earliest documented forms of data visualization were various thematic maps from different cultures and ideograms and hieroglyphs that provided and allowed interpretation of information illustrated. For example,Linear Btablets ofMycenaeprovided a visualization of information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in the Mediterranean. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude at least by 200 BC, and the map projection of a spherical Earth into latitude and longitude byClaudius Ptolemy[c.?85c.?165] in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until the 14th century.[47]\n",
      "The invention of paper and parchment allowed further development of visualizations throughout history. Figure shows a graph from the 10th or possibly 11th century that is intended to be an illustration of the planetary movement, used in an appendix of a textbook in monastery schools.[48]The graph apparently was meant to represent a plot of the inclinations of the planetary orbits as a function of the time. For this purpose, the zone of the zodiac was represented on a plane with a horizontal line divided into thirty parts as the time or longitudinal axis. The vertical axis designates the width of the zodiac. The horizontal scale appears to have been chosen for each planet individually for the periods cannot be reconciled. The accompanying text refers only to the amplitudes. The curves are apparently not related in time.\n",
      "Planetary movements\n",
      "By the 16th century, techniques and instruments for precise observation and measurement of physical quantities, and geographic and celestial position were well-developed (for example, a \"wall quadrant\" constructed byTycho Brahe[15461601], covering an entire wall in his observatory). Particularly important were the development of triangulation and other methods to determine mapping locations accurately.[43]Very early, the measure of time led scholars to develop innovative way of visualizing the data (e.g. Lorenz Codomann in 1596, Johannes Temporarius in 1596[49]).\n",
      "French philosopher and mathematicianRen DescartesandPierre de Fermatdeveloped analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat andBlaise Pascal's work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data.[43]According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped WilliamPlayfair, who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.[39]\n",
      "Playfair TimeSeries\n",
      "In the second half of the 20th century,Jacques Bertinused quantitative graphs to represent information \"intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently\".[39]\n",
      "John Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians. With the progression of technology came the progression of data visualization; starting with hand-drawn visualizations and evolving into more technical applications  including interactive designs leading to software visualization.[50]\n",
      "Programs likeSAS,SOFA,R,Minitab, Cornerstone and more allow for data visualization in the field of statistics. Other data visualization applications, more focused and unique to individuals, programming languages such asD3,Python(through matplotlib, seaborn) andJavaScriptand Java(through JavaFX) help to make the visualization of quantitative data a possibility. Private schools have also developed programs to meet the demand for learning data visualization and associated programming libraries, including free programs likeThe Data Incubatoror paid programs likeGeneral Assembly.[51]\n",
      "Beginning with the symposium \"Data to Discovery\" in 2013, ArtCenter College of Design, Caltech and JPL in Pasadena have run an annual program on interactive data visualization.[52]The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields? By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, combining design thinking and the latest methods from computing, user-centered design, interaction design and 3D graphics.\n",
      "Terminology\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Data visualization involves specific terminology, some of which is derived from statistics. For example, authorStephen Fewdefines two types of data, which are used in combination to support a meaningful analysis or visualization:\n",
      "* Categorical: Represent groups of objects with a particular characteristic. Categorical variables can either be nominal or ordinal. Nominal variables for example gender have no order between them and are thus nominal. Ordinal variables are categories with an order, for sample recording the age group someone falls into.[53]\n",
      "* Quantitative: Represent measurements, such as the height of a person or the temperature of an environment. Quantitative variables can either becontinuous or discrete. Continuous variables capture the idea that measurements can always be made more precisely. While discrete variables have only a finite number of possibilities, such as a count of some outcomes or an age measured in whole years.[53]\n",
      "The distinction between quantitative and categorical variables is important because the two types require different methods of visualization.\n",
      "Two primary types ofinformation displaysare tables and graphs.\n",
      "* Atablecontains quantitative data organized into rows and columns with categorical labels. It is primarily used to look up specific values. In the example above, the table might have categorical column labels representing the name (aqualitative variable) and age (aquantitative variable), with each row of data representing one person (the sampledexperimental unitorcategory subdivision).\n",
      "* Agraphis primarily used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded asvisual objects(e.g., lines, bars, or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one or moreaxes. These axes providescales(quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to ascharts.[54]\n",
      "Eppler and Lengler have developed the \"Periodic Table of Visualization Methods,\" an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods. It includes six types of data visualization methods: data, information, concept, strategy, metaphor and compound.[55]In \"Visualization Analysis and Design\"Tamara Munznerwrites \"Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.\" Munzner argues that visualization \"is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.\"[56]\n",

      "Common interactions include:\n",
      "* Brushing: works by using themouseto control a paintbrush, directly changing the color or glyph of elements of a plot. The paintbrush is sometimes a pointer and sometimes works by drawing an outline of sorts around points; the outline is sometimes irregularly shaped, like a lasso. Brushing is most commonly used when multiple plots are visible and some linking mechanism exists between the plots. There are several different conceptual models for brushing and a number of common linking mechanisms. Brushingscatterplotscan be a transient operation in which points in the active plot only retain their new characteristics. At the same time, they are enclosed or intersected by the brush, or it can be a persistent operation, so that points retain their new appearance after the brush has been moved away. Transient brushing is usually chosen for linked brushing, as we have just described.\n",
      "* Painting: Persistent brushing is useful when we want to group the points into clusters and then proceed to use other operations, such as the tour, to compare the groups. It is becoming common terminology to call the persistent operation painting,\n",
      "* Identification: which could also be called labeling or label brushing, is another plot manipulation that can be linked. Bringing the cursor near a point or edge in a scatterplot, or a bar in abarchart, causes a label to appear that identifies the plot element. It is widely available in many interactive graphics, and is sometimes called mouseover.\n",
      "* Scaling: maps the data onto the window, and changes in the area of the. mapping function help us learn different things from the same plot. Scaling is commonly used to zoom in on crowded regions of a scatterplot, and it can also be used to change the aspect ratio of a plot, to reveal different features of the data.\n",
      "* Linking: connects elements selected in one plot with elements in another plot. The simplest kind of linking, one-to-one, where both plots show different projections of the same data, and a point in one plot corresponds to exactly one point in the other. When using area plots, brushing any part of an area has the same effect as brushing it all and is equivalent to selecting all cases in the corresponding category. Even when some plot elements represent more than one case, the underlying linking rule still links one case in one plot to the same case in other plots. Linking can also be by categorical variable, such as by a subject id, so that all data values corresponding to that subject are highlighted, in all the visible plots.\n",

The first step is identifying what data you want visualised. It is data-driven like profit over the past ten years or a conceptual idea like how a specific organisation is structured. Once this question is answered one can then focus on whether they are trying to communicate information (declarative visualisation) or trying to figure something out (exploratory visualisation). Scott Berinato combines these questions to give four types of visual communication that each have their own goals.[64]\n",

DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, data presentation architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen.

      "Incomputing, adatabaseis an organized collection ofdataor a type ofdata storebased on the use of adatabase management system(DBMS), thesoftwarethat interacts withend users,applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as adatabase system. Often the term \"database\" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.\n",
      "Before digital storage and retrieval of data have become widespread,index cardswere used fordata storagein a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes in acard file. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced byindexing softwarein the 1980s and 1990s.\n",
      "Small databases can be stored on afile system, while large databases are hosted oncomputer clustersorcloud storage. Thedesign of databasesspans formal techniques and practical considerations, includingdata modeling, efficient data representation and storage,query languages,securityandprivacyof sensitive data, anddistributed computingissues, including supportingconcurrentaccess andfault tolerance.\n",
      "Computer scientistsmay classify database management systems according to thedatabase modelsthat they support.Relational databasesbecame dominant in the 1980s. These model data asrowsandcolumnsin a series oftables, and the vast majority useSQLfor writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to asNoSQL, because they use differentquery languages.\n",
      "Terminology and overview\n",
      "Formally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a \"database management system\" (DBMS), which is an integrated set ofcomputer softwarethat allowsusersto interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\n",
      "Because of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.\n",
      "Outside the world of professionalinformation technology, the termdatabaseis often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as aspreadsheetor a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.[1]\n",
      "Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:\n",
      "* Data definition Creation, modification and removal of definitions that detail how the data is to be organized.\n",
      "* Update Insertion, modification, and deletion of the data itself.[2]\n",
      "* Retrieval Selecting data according to specified criteria (e.g., a query, a position in a hierarchy, or a position in relation to other data) and providing that data either directly to the user, or making it available for further processing by the database itself or by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a more or less direct form without modification, as it is stored in the database, or in a new form obtained by altering it or combining it with existing data from the database.[3]\n",
      "* Administration Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.[4]\n",
      "Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particulardatabase model.[5]\"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.[6]\n",
      "Physically, databaseserversare dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usuallymultiprocessorcomputers, with generous memory andRAIDdisk arrays used for stable storage. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large-volumetransaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of mostdatabase applications. DBMSs may be built around a custommultitaskingkernelwith built-innetworkingsupport, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standardoperating systemto provide these functions.[citation needed]\n",
      "Since DBMSs comprise a significantmarket, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.[7]\n",
      "Databases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such asrelationalorXML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from aserver clusterto amobile phone), thequery language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL orXQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance,scalability, resilience, and security.\n",
      "History\n",
      "The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas ofprocessors,computer memory,computer storage, andcomputer networks. The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct accessstorage mediasuch asmagnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data onmagnetic tape. The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure:navigational,[8]SQL/relational, and post-relational.\n",
      "The two main early navigationaldata modelswere thehierarchical modeland theCODASYLmodel (network model). These were characterized by the use ofpointers(often physical disk addresses) to follow relationships from one record to another.\n",
      "Therelational model, first proposed in 1970 byEdgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting thatapplicationsshould search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type ofentity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scaledata processingapplications, and as of 2018they remain dominant:IBM Db2,Oracle,MySQL, andMicrosoft SQL Serverare the most searchedDBMS.[9]The dominant database language, standardized SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.[citation needed]\n",
      "Object databaseswere developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience ofobjectrelational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also the development of hybridobjectrelational databases.\n",
      "The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known asNoSQLdatabases, introducing fastkeyvalue storesanddocument-oriented databases. A competing \"next generation\" known asNewSQLdatabases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.\n",

      "Basic structure of navigationalCODASYLdatabase model\n",
      "The introduction of the termdatabasecoincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than dailybatch processing. TheOxford English Dictionarycites a 1962 report by theSystem Development Corporationof California as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.[10]\n",
      "As computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, andCharles Bachman, author of one such product, theIntegrated Data Store(IDS), founded theDatabase Task GroupwithinCODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization ofCOBOL. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as theCODASYL approach, and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.\n",
      "The CODASYL approach offered applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:\n",
      "1. Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented byhashing)\n",
      "2. Navigating relationships (calledsets) from one record to another\n",
      "3. Scanning all the records in a sequential order\n",
      "Later systems addedB-treesto provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end users (as distinct from the navigationalAPI). However, CODASYL databases were complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.\n",
      "IBMalso had its own DBMS in 1966, known asInformation Management System(IMS). IMS was a development of software written for theApollo programon theSystem/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed: the term was popularized by Bachman's 1973Turing AwardpresentationThe Programmer as Navigator. IMS is classified by IBM as ahierarchical database. IDMS andCincom Systems'TOTALdatabases are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use as of 2014.[11]\n",
      "1970s, relational DBMS\n",
      "Edgar F. Coddworked at IBM inSan Jose, California, in an office primarily involved in the development ofhard disksystems.[12]He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreakingA Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.[13]\n",
      "The paper described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort oflinked listof free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to organize the data as a number of \"tables\", each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as aprimary keyby which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system ofrelational calculus(from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (orrelations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables calledviewscould present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.\n",
      "Codd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than tables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early implementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to depart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based.\n",
      "In therelational model, records are \"linked\" using virtual keys not stored in the database but defined as needed between the data contained in the records.\n",
      "The use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to represent cross-table relationships, rather than disk addresses, had two primary motivations. From an engineering perspective, it enabled tables to be relocated and resized without expensive database reorganization. But Codd was more interested in the difference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean mathematical definitions, and it also enabled query operations to be defined in terms of the established discipline offirst-order predicate calculus; because these operations have clean mathematical properties, it becomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct ways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is no loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic or network models, though the connections between tables are no longer so explicit.\n",
      "In the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal structure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a \"repeating group\" within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to such internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical keys.\n",
      "For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single variable-length record. In the relational approach, the data would benormalizedinto a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.\n",
      "As well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd changed the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than requiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would use a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access path by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the responsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in terms of mathematical logic.\n",
      "Codd's paper inspired teams at various universities to research the subject, including one atUniversity of California, Berkeley[12]led byEugene WongandMichael Stonebraker, who startedINGRESusing funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar toSystem Rin a number of ways, including the use of a \"language\" fordata access, known asQUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.\n",
      "IBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model,PRTV, and a production one,Business System 12, both now discontinued.HoneywellwroteMRDSforMultics, and now there are two new implementations:Alphora Dataphorand Rel. Most other DBMS implementations usually calledrelationalare actually SQL DBMSs.\n",
      "In 1970, the University of Michigan began development of theMICRO Information Management System[14]based onD.L. Childs' Set-Theoretic Data model.[15][16][17]The university in 1974 hosted a debate between Codd and Bachman which Bruce Lindsay of IBM later described as \"throwing lightning bolts at each other!\".[12]MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by theUS Department of Labor, theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers from theUniversity of Alberta, theUniversity of Michigan, andWayne State University. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using theMichigan Terminal System.[18]The system remained in production until 1998.\n",

      "Main article:Database machine\n",
      "In the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at a lower cost. Examples wereIBM System/38, the early offering ofTeradata, and theBritton Lee, Inc.database machine.\n",
      "Another approach to hardware support for database management wasICL'sCAFSaccelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However, this idea is still pursued in certain applications by some companies likeNetezzaand Oracle (Exadata).\n",
      "Late 1970s, SQL DBMS\n",
      "IBM formed a team led by Codd that started working on a prototype system,System Rdespite opposition from others at the company.[12]The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardizedquery language SQL[citation needed] had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known asSQL/DS, and, later,Database 2(IBM Db2).\n",
      "Larry Ellison's Oracle Database (or more simply,Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM's papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it was not until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.[19]\n",
      "Stonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known asPostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission-critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primarydata store, as do many large companies and financial institutions).\n",
      "In Sweden, Codd's paper was also read andMimer SQLwas developed in the mid-1970s atUppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise.\n",
      "Another data model, theentityrelationship model, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity fordatabase designas it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entityrelationship constructs were retrofitted as adata modelingconstruct for the relational model, and the difference between the two has become irrelevant.[citation needed]\n",

      "Besides IBM and various software companies such asSybaseandInformix Corporation, most large computer hardware vendors by the 1980s had their own database systems such asDEC'sVAX Rdb/VMS.[20]The decade ushered in the age ofdesktop computing. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets likeLotus 1-2-3and database software likedBASE. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box.C. Wayne Ratliff, the creator of dBASE, stated: \"dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.\"[21]dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n",
      "1990s, object-oriented\n",
      "By the start of the decade databases had become a billion-dollar industry in about ten years.[20]The 1990s, along with a rise inobject-oriented programming, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases asobjects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be related to objects and theirattributesand not to individual fields.[22]The term \"objectrelational impedance mismatch\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables.Object databasesandobjectrelational databasesattempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known asobjectrelational mappings(ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.\n",

Databases as digital objects contain three layers of information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and the semantics. Proper storage of all three layers is needed for futurepreservationand longevity of the database.[37]Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of thedatabase enginea.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems'file systemsas intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration settings are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look at the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).\n",

      "Often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storingmaterialized views, which consist of frequently neededexternal viewsor query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\n",
      "Replication\n",
      "See also:Replication (computing) Database replication\n",
      "Occasionally a database employs storage redundancy bydatabase objectsreplication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to the same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\n",
      "Virtualization\n",
      "Withdata virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach.[38]\n",
      "Security\n",
      "\n",
      "This articleappears to contradict the articleDatabase security.Please discuss at thetalk pageand do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved.(March 2013)\n",
      "Main article:Database security\n",
      "Database securitydeals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).\n",
      "Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) are allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.\n",
      "This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals andprivilegesto groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.\n",
      "Data securityin general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., seephysical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., seedata encryption).\n",
      "Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensicdatabase auditlater by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this in the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches. Therefore, organizations must take database security seriously because of the many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransom ware. This helps in protecting the company's essential information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause.[39]\n",
      "Transactions and concurrency\n",
      "Further information:Concurrency control\n",
      "Database transactionscan be used to introduce some level offault toleranceanddata integrityafter recovery from acrash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring or releasing alock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands).\n",
      "The acronymACIDdescribes some ideal properties of a database transaction:atomicity,consistency,isolation, anddurability.\n",
      "Migration\n",
      "See also:Data migration Database migration\n",
      "A database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have differenttotal costs of ownershipor TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This is in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help import databases from other popular DBMSs.\n",
      "Building, maintaining, and tuning\n",
      "Main article:Database tuning\n",
      "After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the neededuser interfacesto be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).\n",
      "When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.\n",
      "After the database is created, initialized and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc.\n",
      "Backup and restore\n",
      "Main article:Backup\n",
      "Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.\n",
      "Static analysis\n",
      "Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *Abstract interpretationframework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques.[40]The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database systems has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine-grained access control, watermarking, etc.\n",
      "Miscellaneous features\n",
      "Other DBMS features might include:\n",
      "* Database logs This helps in keeping a history of the executed functions.\n",
      "* Graphics component for producing graphs and charts, especially in a data warehouse system.\n",
      "* Query optimizer Performs query optimization on every query to choose an efficientquery plan(a partial order (tree) of operations) to be executed to compute the query result. May be specific to a particular storage engine.\n",
      "* Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program maintenance, database performance analysis and monitoring, database configuration monitoring, DBMS hardware configuration (a DBMS and related database may span computers, networks, and storage units) and related database mapping (especially for a distributed DBMS), storage allocation and database layout monitoring, storage migration, etc.\n",
      "Increasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as \"DevOpsfor database\".[41]\n",
      "Design and modeling\n",
      "Main article:Database design\n",
      "\n",
      "The first task of a database designer is to produce aconceptual data modelthat reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop anentityrelationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is theUnified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.\n",
      "Producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input frombusiness processes, or the analysis ofworkflowin the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.\n",
      "Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into aschemathat implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is alogical data modelexpressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The termsdata modelanddatabase modelare often used interchangeably, but in this article we usedata modelfor the design of a specific database, anddatabase modelfor the modeling notation used to express that design).\n",
      "The most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known asnormalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.\n",
      "The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often calledphysical database design, and the output is thephysical data model. A key goal during this stage isdata independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.\n",
      "Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both definingaccess controlto database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.\n",
      "Models\n",
      "Main article:Database model\n",
      "Collage of five types of database models\n",
      "A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which mannerdatacan be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.\n",
      "Common logical data models for databases include:\n",
      "* Navigational databases\n",
      "* Hierarchical database model\n",
      "* Network model\n",
      "* Graph database\n",
      "* Relational model\n",
      "* Entityrelationship model\n",
      "* Enhanced entityrelationship model\n",
      "* Object model\n",

      "An objectrelational database combines the two related structures.\n",
      "Physical data modelsinclude:\n",
      "* Inverted index\n",

      "Other models include:\n",
      "* Multidimensional model\n",

      "* Event store\n",
      "* Time series model\n",
      "External, conceptual, and internal views\n",
      "Traditional view of data[42]\n",
      "A database management system provides three views of the database data:\n",
      "* Theexternal leveldefines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.\n",
      "* Theconceptual level(orlogical level) unifies the various external views into a compatible global view.[43]It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.\n",
      "* Theinternal level(orphysical level) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such asindexesto enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.\n",
      "While there is typically only one conceptual and internal view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of thehuman resourcesdepartment. Thus different departments need differentviewsof the company's database.\n",
      "The three-level database architecture relates to the concept ofdata independencewhich was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model.[43]The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\n",
      "The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On the one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both inacademiaand in the research and development groups of companies (for exampleIBM Research). Research activity includestheoryand development ofprototypes. Notable research topics have includedmodels, the atomic transaction concept, relatedconcurrency controltechniques, query languages andquery optimizationmethods,RAID, and more.\n",
      "The database research area has several dedicatedacademic journals(for example,ACM Transactions on Database Systems-TODS,Data and Knowledge Engineering-DKE) and annualconferences(e.g.,ACMSIGMOD, ACMPODS,VLDB,IEEEICDE).\n",

      "Databases\n",
      "A database is a structured collection of data managed by a database management system (DBMS). This setup allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, typically using a query language like SQL. Databases are designed for:\n",
      "* Consistency  Data is well-organized and follows rules (like constraints and schemas).\n",
      "* Scalability  Databases can handle large volumes of data and many users.\n",
      "* Security  User access and data integrity are managed carefully.\n",
      "* Multi-user access  Multiple people can interact with the data at once with proper concurrency controls.\n",
      "Types include:\n",
      "* Relational (SQL)\n",
      "* NoSQL (document, graph, key-value)\n",
      "* In-memory, cloud, distributed, etc.\n",
      "* Other Forms of Data Organization\n",
      "* These alternatives are often simpler but offer less structure and fewer tools for querying or control:\n",
      "* Spreadsheets (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets)\n",
      "* Good for small-scale, simple datasets\n",
      "* Easy to use for non-technical users\n",
      "* Limited in handling complex relationships or scaling\n",
      "Flat files (e.g., CSV, TXT)\n",
      "* Data stored in plain text, with minimal structure\n",
      "* Lightweight and portable\n",
      "* Not ideal for relational data or complex queries\n",
      "Paper-based systems\n",
      "* Index cards, filing cabinets, etc. (yes, still used in some cases!)\n",
      "* No digital queryingsearch is manual\n",
      "* Vulnerable to loss or damage\n",
      "XML/JSON files\n",
      "* Hierarchical or document-based storage\n",
      "* Frequently used for data interchange between systems\n",
      "* Not optimized for complex, large-scale querying on their own\n",
      "Why Choose a Database?\n",
      "If youre dealing with large datasets, frequent updates, relationships between data points, or multiple users needing access at the same timea database is the way to go.\n",
      "Curious about what kind of data youre organizing? Id be happy to recommend the right tool or structure for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "NoSQL\n",
      "NoSQL (short for \"Not Only SQL\") refers to a broad class of database systems that differ from traditional relational databases in how they store, manage, and retrieve data.\n",
      "?? What Makes NoSQL Different?\n",
      "Unlike relational databases that use structured tables and SQL for queries, NoSQL databases:\n",
      "* Dont require a fixed schema  great for evolving data models.\n",
      "* Handle unstructured or semi-structured data  like JSON, XML, or key-value pairs.\n",
      "* Scale horizontally  meaning you can add more servers to handle more data.\n",
      "* Prioritize performance and flexibility  especially for big data and real-time applications.\n",

      "Thesedatasetsare used inmachine learning (ML)research and have been cited inpeer-reviewedacademic journals. Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. Major advances in this field can result from advances in learningalgorithms(such asdeep learning),computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets.[1]High-quality labeled training datasets forsupervisedandsemi-supervisedmachine learningalgorithmsare usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets forunsupervisedlearning can also be difficult and costly to produce.[2][3][4]\n",

      "Adocument management system(DMS) is usually a computerized system used to store, share, track and manage files or documents. Some systems include history tracking where a log of the various versions created and modified by different users is recorded. The term has some overlap with the concepts ofcontent management systems. It is often viewed as a component ofenterprise content management(ECM) systems and related todigital asset management,document imaging,workflowsystems andrecords managementsystems.\n",
      "History\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "While manyelectronic document management systemsstore documents in their native file format (Microsoft WordorExcel,PDF), some web-based document management systems are beginning to store content in the form ofHTML. These HTML-based document management systems can act as publishing systems or policy management systems.[1]Content is captured either by using browser based editors or the importing and conversion of not HTML content. Storing documents as HTML enables a simpler full-text workflow as most search engines deal with HTML natively. DMS without an HTML storage format is required to extract the text from the proprietary format making the full text search workflow slightly more complicated.\n",
      "Search capabilities includingboolean queries,cluster analysis, andstemming[2]have become critical components of DMS as users have grown used to internet searching and spend less time organizing their content.\n",
      "Components\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Document management systems commonly provide storage, versioning, metadata, security, as well as indexing and retrieval capabilities. Here is a description of these components:\n",
      "Topic\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Metadata\n",
      "Metadatais typically stored for each document.Metadatamay, for example, include the date the document will be stored and the identity of the user storing it. The DMS may also extract metadata from the document automatically or prompt the user to add metadata. Some systems also useoptical character recognitionon scanned images, or perform text extraction on electronic documents. The resulting extracted text can be used to assist users in locating documents by identifying probable keywords or providing for full text search capability, or can be used on its own. Extracted text can also be stored as a component of metadata, stored with the document, or separately from the document as a source for searching document collections.[3]\n",
      "Integration\n",
      "Many document management systems attempt to provide document management functionality directly to other applications, so that users may retrieve existing documents directly from the document management system repository, make changes, and save the changed document back to the repository as a new version, all without leaving the application. Such integration is commonly available for a variety of software tools such asworkflow managementandcontent management systems, typically through anapplication programming interface(API) using open standards such asODMA,LDAP,WebDAV, andSOAPorRESTfulweb services.[4][5]\n",
      "Capture\n",
      "Capture primarily involves accepting and processing images of paper documents fromscannersormultifunction printers.Optical character recognition(OCR) software is often used, whether integrated into the hardware or as stand-alone software, in order to convert digital images into machine readable text.Optical mark recognition(OMR) software is sometimes used to extract values of check-boxes or bubbles. Capture may also involve accepting electronic documents and other computer-based files.[6]\n",
      "Data validation\n",
      "Data validation rules can check for document failures, missing signatures, misspelled names, and other issues, recommending real-time correction options before importing data into the DMS. Additional processing in the form of harmonization and data format changes may also be applied as part of data validation.[7][8]\n",
      "Indexing\n",
      "Indexing tracks electronic documents. Indexing may be as simple as keeping track of unique document identifiers; but often it takes a more complex form, providing classification through the documents' metadata or even through word indexes extracted from the documents' contents. Indexing exists mainly to support information query and retrieval. One area of critical importance for rapid retrieval is the creation of an indextopologyor scheme.[9]\n",
      "Storage\n",
      "Store electronic documents. Storage of the documents often includes management of those same documents; where they are stored, for how long, migration of the documents from one storage media to another (hierarchical storage management) and eventual document destruction.\n",
      "Retrieval\n",
      "Retrieve the electronic documents from the storage. Although the notion of retrieving a particular document is simple, retrieval in the electronic context can be quite complex and powerful. Simple retrieval of individual documents can be supported by allowing the user to specify the unique document identifier, and having the system use the basic index (or a non-indexed query on its data store) to retrieve the document.[9]More flexible retrieval allows the user to specify partial search terms involving the document identifier and/or parts of the expected metadata. This would typically return a list of documents which match the user's search terms. Some systems provide the capability to specify aBoolean expressioncontaining multiple keywords or example phrases expected to exist within the documents' contents. The retrieval for this kind of query may be supported by previously built indexes,[9]or may perform more time-consuming searches through the documents' contents to return a list of the potentially relevant documents.See alsoDocument retrieval.\n",
      "Distribution\n",
      "A document ready for distribution has to be in a format that cannot be easily altered. An original master copy of the document is usually never used for distribution; rather, an electronic link to the document itself is more common. If a document is to be distributed electronically in a regulatory environment, then additional criteria must be met, including assurances of traceability and versioning, even across other systems.[10]This approach applies to both of the systems by which the document is to be inter-exchanged, if the integrity of the document is imperative.\n",
      "Security\n",
      "Document security is vital in many document management applications. Compliance requirements for certain documents can be quite complex depending on the type of documents. For instance, in theUnited States, standards such asISO 9001andISO 13485, as well as U.S.Food and Drug Administrationregulations, dictate how the document control process should be addressed.[11]Document management systems may have a rights management module that allows an administrator to give access to documents based on type to only certain people or groups of people. Document marking at the time of printing or PDF-creation is an essential element to preclude alteration or unintended use.\n",
      "Workflow\n",
      "Workflow is a complex process, and some document management systems have either a built-in workflow module[12]or can integrate with workflow management tools.[5]There are different types of workflow. Usage depends on the environment to which the electronic document management system (EDMS) is applied. Manual workflow requires a user to view the document and decide whom to send it to. Rules-based workflow allows an administrator to create a rule that dictates the flow of the document through an organization: for instance, an invoice passes through an approval process and then is routed to the accounts-payable department. Dynamic rules allow for branches to be created in a workflow process. A simple example would be to enter an invoice amount and if the amount is lower than a certain set amount, it follows different routes through the organization. Advanced workflow mechanisms can manipulate content or signal external processes while these rules are in effect.\n",
      "Collaboration\n",
      "Collaboration should be inherent in an EDMS. In its basic form, collaborative EDMS should allow documents to be retrieved and worked on by an authorized user. Access should be blocked to other users while work is being performed on the document. Other advanced forms of collaboration act in real time, allowing multiple users to view and modify (or markup) documents at the same time. The resulting document is comprehensive, including all users additions. Collaboration within document management systems means that the various markups by each individual user during the collaboration session are recorded, allowing document history to be monitored.[13]\n",
      "Versioning\n",
      "Versioning is a process by which documents are checked in or out of the document management system, allowing users to retrieve previous versions and to continue work from a selected point. Versioning is useful for documents that change over time and require updating, but it may be necessary to go back to or reference a previous copy.[13]\n",
      "Searching\n",
      "Searching finds documents and folders using template attributes or full text search. Documents can be searched using various attributes and document content.\n",
      "Federated search\n",
      "This refers to the capability to extend search capabilities to draw results from multiple sources, or from multiple DMSes within an enterprise.[14]\n",
      "Publishing\n",
      "Publishing a document involves the procedures ofproofreading,peeror public reviewing, authorizing, printing and approving etc. Those steps ensureprudenceand logical thinking. Any careless handling may result in the inaccuracy of the document and therefore mislead or upset its users and readers. In law regulated industries, some of the procedures have to be completed as evidenced by their corresponding signatures and the date(s) on which the document was signed. Refer to theISOdivisions of ICS 01.140.40 and 35.240.30 for further information.[15][16]\n",
      "The published document should be in a format that is not easily altered without a specific knowledge or tools, and yet it is read-only or portable.[17]\n",
      "Hard copy reproduction\n",
      "Document/image reproduction is often necessary within a document management system, and its supported output devices and reproduction capabilities should be considered.[18]\n",
      "Standardization\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Many industry associations publish their own lists of particular document control standards that are used in their particular field. Following is a list of some of the relevant ISO documents. Divisions ICS 01.140.10 and 01.140.20.[19][20]The ISO has also published a series of standards regarding thetechnical documentation, covered by the division of 01.110.[21]\n",

      "[ ]\n",
      "Government regulationstypically require that companies working in certain industries control their documents. ADocument Controlleris responsible to control these documents strictly. These industries include accounting (for example: 8thEU Directive,SarbanesOxley Act), food safety (for example theFood Safety Modernization Actin the US), ISO (mentioned above), medical device manufacturing (FDA), manufacture of blood, human cells, and tissue products (FDA), healthcare (JCAHO), and information technology (ITIL).[22]Some industries work under stricter document control requirements due to the type of information they retain for privacy, warranty, or other highly regulated purposes. Examples includeprotected health information(PHI) as required byHIPAAor construction project documents required for warranty periods. An information systems strategy plan (ISSP) can shape organisational information systems over medium to long-term periods.[23]\n",
      "Documents stored in a document management systemsuch as procedures, work instructions, and policy statementsprovide evidence of documents under control. Failing to comply can cause fines, the loss of business, or damage to a business's reputation.\n",
      "Document control includes:[24]\n",
      "* reviewing and approving documents prior to release\n",
      "* ensuring changes and revisions are clearly identified\n",
      "* ensuring that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at their \"points of use\"\n",
      "* ensuring that documents remain legible and identifiable\n",
      "* ensuring that external documents (such as customer-supplied documents or supplier manuals) are identified and controlled\n",

In this context 'documents' are any of a myriad of information assets including images, office documents, graphics, and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as Web pages, email, instant messages, and video.\n",
      "Document management software\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Paper documents have long been used in storinginformation. However, paper can be costly and, if used excessively, wasteful. Document management software is not simply a tool but it lets a user manage access, track and edit information stored. Document management software is anelectroniccabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files.[25]The software helps thebusinessesto combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned anddigital formatsget imported.[26]One of the most important benefits ofdigital documentmanagement is a fail-safe environment for safeguarding alldocumentsand data.[27]In the heavy construction industry specifically, document management software allows team members to securely view and upload documents for projects they are assigned to from anywhere and at any time to help streamline day-to-day operations.[28]\n",

      "Electronic Discovery\n",
      "Electronic discovery(alsoediscoveryore-discovery) refers todiscoveryin legal proceedings such aslitigation, government investigations, orFreedom of Information Actrequests, where the information sought is inelectronic format(often referred to aselectronically stored informationor ESI).[1]Electronic discovery is subject to rules ofcivil procedureand agreed-upon processes, often involving review forprivilegeandrelevancebefore data are turned over to the requesting party.\n",
      "Electronic information is considered different from paper information because of its intangible form, volume, transience and persistence. Electronic information is usually accompanied bymetadatathat is not found in paper documents and that can play an important part as evidence (e.g. the date and time a document was written could be useful in acopyrightcase). The preservation of metadata from electronic documents creates special challenges to preventspoliation.\n",
      "In the United States, at the federal level, electronic discovery is governed bycommon law, case law and specific statutes, but primarily by theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure(FRCP), includingamendmentseffective December 1, 2006, and December 1, 2015.[2][3]In addition, state law and regulatory agencies increasingly also address issues relating to electronic discovery. InEngland and Wales, Part 31 of theCivil Procedure Rules[4]and Practice Direction 31B on Disclosure of Electronic Documents apply.[5]Other jurisdictions around the world also have rules relating to electronic discovery.\n",
      "Stages of process\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "TheElectronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM)is an ubiquitous diagram that represents a conceptual view of these stages involved in the ediscovery process.\n",
      "Identification\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The identification phase is when potentially responsive documents are identified for further analysis and review. In the United States, inZubulake v. UBS Warburg,Shira Scheindlinruled that failure to issue a writtenlegal holdnotice whenever litigation is reasonably anticipated will be deemed grossly negligent. This holding brought additional focus to the concepts of legal holds, eDiscovery, and electronic preservation.[6]Custodians who are in possession of potentially relevant information or documents are identified.Data mappingtechniques are often employed to ensure a complete identification of data sources. Since the scope of data can be overwhelming or uncertain in this phase, attempts are made to reasonably reduce the overall scope during this phase - such as limiting the identification of documents to a certain date range or custodians.\n",
      "Preservation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A duty to preserve begins upon the reasonable anticipation of litigation. Data identified as potentially relevant during preservation is placed in alegal hold. This ensures that data cannot be destroyed. Care is taken to ensure this process is defensible, while the end goal is to reduce the possibility of data spoliation or destruction. Failure to preserve can lead to sanctions. Even if a court does not rule that the failure to preserve is negligence, they can force the accused to pay fines if the lost data puts the defense \"at an undue disadvantage in establishing their defense.\"[7]\n",
      "Collection\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Once documents have been preserved, collection can begin. The collection is the transfer of data from a company to its legal counsel, who will determine the relevance and disposition of data. Some companies that deal with frequent litigation have software in place to quickly place legal holds on certain custodians when an event (such as legal notice) is triggered and begin the collection process immediately.[8]Other companies may need to call in adigital forensicsexpert to prevent the spoliation of data. The size and scale of this collection are determined by the identification phase.\n",
      "Processing\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "During the processing phase, native files are prepared to be loaded into adocument reviewplatform. Often, this phase also involves the extraction of text andmetadatafrom the native files. Various data culling techniques are employed during this phase, such as deduplication and de-NISTing. Sometimes native files will be converted to a petrified, paper-like format (such as PDF or TIFF) at this stage to allow for easier redaction andbates-labeling.\n",
      "Modern processing tools can also employ advancedanalytictools to help document review attorneys more accurately identify potentially relevant documents.\n",
      "Review\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "During the review phase, documents are reviewed for responsiveness to discovery requests and for privilege. Different document review platforms and services can assist in many tasks related to this process, including rapidly identifying potentially relevant documents and culling documents according to various criteria (such as keyword, date range, etc.). Most review tools also make it easy for large groups of document review attorneys to work on cases, featuring collaborative tools and batches to speed up the review process and eliminate work duplication.\n",
      "Analysis\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Qualitative analysis of the content discovered in the collection phase and after being reduced by the preprocessing phase. The Evidence is looked at in context. Correlation analysis or contextual analysis to extract structured information relevant to the case. Structuring the data along a timeline or clustered by topic is common. For example, one can arrange evidence by how it relates members of a group as a form ofsocial network analysis.\n",
      "Production\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Documents are turned over to opposing counsel based on agreed-upon specifications. Often this production is accompanied by a load file, which is used to load documents into a document review platform. Documents can be produced either as native files or in a petrified format (such asPDForTIFF) alongsidemetadata.\n",
      "Presentation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Displaying and explaining evidence before audiences (at depositions, hearings, trials, etc.). The idea is that the audience understands the presentation, and non-professionals can follow the interpretation. Clarity and ease of understanding are the focus here. The native form of data needs to be abstracted, visualized, and broad into context for the presentation. The results of the analysis should be the subject of the presentation. The clear documentation should provide reproducibility.\n",
      "Types of electronically stored information\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Any data that is stored in an electronic form may be subject to production under common eDiscovery rules. This type of data has historically included email and office documents (spreadsheets, presentations, documents, PDFs, etc.) but can also include photos, video, instant messaging, collaboration tools, text (SMS), messaging apps, social media, ephemeral messaging, Internet of things (smart devices likesmart watches,virtual assistants, andsmart home hubs), databases, and other file types.\n",
      "Also included in ediscovery is \"raw data\", which forensic investigators can review for hidden evidence. The original file format is known as the\"native\" format. Litigators may review material from ediscovery in one of several formats: printed paper, \"native file\", or a petrified, paper-like format, such as PDF files or TIFF images. Modern document review platforms accommodate the use of native files and allow for them to be converted to TIFF andBates-stamped for use in court.\n",
      "Electronic messages\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In 2006, theU.S. Supreme Court's amendments to theFederal Rules of Civil Procedurecreated a category for electronic records that, for the first time, explicitly named emails and instant message chats as likely records to be archived and produced when relevant.\n",
      "One type of preservation problem arose during theZubulake v. UBS Warburglawsuit. Throughout the case, the plaintiff claimed that the evidence needed to prove the case existed in emails stored on UBS' own computer systems. Because the emails requested were either never found or destroyed, the court found that they were more likely to exist than not. The court found that while the corporation's counsel directed that all potential discovery evidence, including emails, be preserved, the staff that the directive applied to did not follow through. This resulted in significantsanctionsagainst UBS.\n",
      "To establish authenticity, some archiving systems apply a unique code to each archived message or chat. The systems prevent alterations to original messages, messages cannot be deleted, and unauthorized persons cannot access the messages.\n",
      "The formalized changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in December 2006 and 2007 effectively forced civil litigants into a compliance mode with respect to their proper retention and management ofelectronically stored information(ESI). Improper management of ESI can result in a finding of spoliation of evidence and the imposition of one or more sanctions, including adverse inference jury instructions,summary judgment, monetary fines, and other sanctions. In some cases, such asQualcomm v. Broadcom, attorneys can be brought before the bar.[9]\n",
      "Databases and other structured data\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Structured data typically resides in databases or datasets. It is organized in tables with columns, rows, and defined data types. The most common are Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) that are capable of handling large volumes of data such asOracle,IBM Db2,Microsoft SQL Server,Sybase, andTeradata. The structured data domain also includes spreadsheets (not all spreadsheets contain structured data, but those that have data organized in database-like tables), desktop databases likeFileMakerPro andMicrosoft Access, structuredflat files,XMLfiles,data marts,data warehouses, etc.\n",
      "Audio\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Voicemail is often discoverable under electronic discovery rules. Employers may have a duty to retain voicemail if there is an anticipation of litigation involving that employee. Data from voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Siri have been used in criminal cases.[10]\n",
      "Reporting formats\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Although petrifying documents to static image formats (TIFF&JPEG) had become the standard document review method for almost two decades, native format review has increased in popularity as a method for document review since around 2004. Because it requires the review of documents in their original file formats, applications and toolkits capable of opening multiple file formats have also become popular. This is also true in the ECM (Enterprise Content Management) storage markets, which converge quickly with ESI technologies.\n",
      "Petrification involves the conversion of native files into an image format that does not require the use of native applications. This is useful in theredactionofprivilegedor sensitive information since redaction tools for images are traditionally more mature and easier to apply on uniform image types by non-technical people. Efforts to redact similarly petrified PDF files by incompetent personnel have removed redacted layers and exposed redacted information, such as social security numbers and other private information.[11][12]\n",
      "Traditionally, electronic discovery vendors had been contracted to convert native files into TIFF images (for example, 10 images for a 10-pageMicrosoft Worddocument) with a load file for use in image-based discovery review database applications. Increasingly, database review applications have embedded native file viewers with TIFF capabilities. With both native and image file capabilities, it could either increase or decrease the total necessary storage since there may be multiple formats and files associated with each individual native file. Deployment, storage, and best practices are becoming especially critical and necessary to maintain cost-effective strategies.\n",
      "Structured data are most often produced in delimited text format. When the number of tables subject to discovery is large or relationships between the tables are of essence, the data are produced in native database format or as a database backup file.[13]\n",
      "Common issues\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A number of different people may be involved in an electronic discovery project: lawyers for both parties, forensic specialists, IT managers, and records managers, amongst others. Forensic examination often uses specialized terminology (for example, \"image\" refers to theacquisitionof digital media), which can lead to confusion.[1]\n",
      "While attorneys involved in case litigation try their best to understand the companies and organizations they represent, they may fail to understand the policies and practices that are in place in the company'sITdepartment. As a result, some data may be destroyedaftera legal hold has been issued by unknowing technicians performing their regular duties. Many companies are deploying software that properly preserves data across the network to combat this trend, preventing inadvertent data spoliation.\n",
      "Given the complexities of modern litigation and the wide variety of information systems on the market, electronic discovery often requires IT professionals from both the attorney's office (or vendor) and the parties to the litigation to communicate directly to address technology incompatibilities and agree on production formats. Failure to get expert advice from knowledgeable personnel often leads to additional time and unforeseen costs in acquiring new technology or adapting existing technologies to accommodate the collected data.\n",
      "Emerging trends\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Alternative collection methods\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Currently the two main approaches for identifying responsive material on custodian machines are:\n",
      "(1) where physical access to the organizations network is possible - agents are installed on each custodian machine which push large amounts of data for indexing across the network to one or more servers that have to be attached to the network or\n",
      "(2) for instances where it is impossible or impractical to attend the physical location of the custodian system - storage devices are attached to custodian machines (or company servers) and then each collection instance is manually deployed.\n",
      "In relation to the first approach there are several issues:\n",
      "* In a typical collection process large volumes of data are transmitted across the network for indexing and this impacts normal business operations\n",
      "* The indexing process is not 100% reliable in finding responsive material\n",
      "* IT administrators are generally unhappy with the installation of agents on custodian machines\n",
      "* The number of concurrent custodian machines that can be processed is severely limited due to the network bandwidth required\n",
      "New technology is able to address problems created by the first approach by running an application entirely in memory on each custodian machine and only pushing responsive data across the network. This process has been patented[14]and embodied in a tool that has been the subject of a conference paper.[15]\n",
      "In relation to the second approach, despite self-collection being a hot topic in eDiscovery, concerns are being addressed by limiting the involvement of the custodian to simply plugging in a device and running an application to create an encrypted container of responsive documents.[16]\n",
      "Regardless of the method adopted to collect and process data there are few resources available for practitioners to evaluate the different tools. This is an issue due to the significant cost of eDiscovery solutions. Notwithstanding the limited options for obtaining trial licences for the tools, a significant barrier to the evaluation process is creating a suitable environment in which to test such tools. Adams suggests the use of the Microsoft Deployment Lab which automatically creates a small virtual network running under HyperV.[17]\n",
      "Technology-assisted review\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Technology-assisted review (TAR)also known as computer-assisted review or predictive codinginvolves the application ofsupervised machine learningorrule-basedapproaches to infer the relevance (or responsiveness, privilege, or other categories of interest) of ESI.[18]Technology-assisted review has evolved rapidly since its inceptioncirca2005.[19][20]\n",
      "Following research studies indicating its effectiveness,[21][22]TAR was first recognized by a U.S. court in 2012,[23]by an Irish court in 2015,[24]and by the High Court in England in 2016.[25]\n",
      "In 2015,US District Court for the Southern District of New Yorkhas declared that it is \"black letter lawthat where the producing party wants to utilize TAR for document review, courts will permit it.\"[26]The following year, that court stated,[27]\n",
      "To be clear, the Court believes that for most cases today, TAR is the best and most efficient search tool. That is particularly so, according to research studies (cited in Rio Tinto[26]), where the TAR methodology uses continuous active learning (\"CAL\")[28]which eliminates issues about the seed set and stabilizing the TAR tool. The Court would have liked the City to use TAR in this case. But the Court cannot, and will not, force the City to do so. There may come a time when TAR is so widely used that it might be unreasonable for a party to decline to use TAR. We are not there yet. Thus, despite what the Court might want a responding party to do, Sedona Principle 6[29]controls. Hyles' application to force the City to use TAR is DENIED.\n",
      "Maura R. GrossmanandGordon Cormackhave defined TAR as:\n",
      "A process for Prioritizing or Coding a Collection of Documents using a computerized system that harnesses human judgments of one or more Subject Matter Expert(s) on a smaller set of Documents and then extrapolates those judgments to the remaining Document Collection. Some TAR methods use Machine Learning Algorithms to distinguish Relevant from Non-Relevant Documents, based on Training Examples Coded as Relevant or Non-Relevant by the Subject Matter Experts(s), while other TAR methods derive systematic Rules that emulate the expert(s) decision-making process. TAR processes generally incorporate Statistical Models and/or Sampling techniques to guide the process and to measure overall system effectiveness.[30]\n",
      "Convergence with information governance\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Anecdotal evidence for this emerging trend points to the business value ofinformation governance(IG), defined byGartneras \"the specification of decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the valuation, creation, storage, use, archival, and deletion of information. It includes the processes, roles, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.\"\n",
      "As compared to eDiscovery, information governance as a discipline is relatively new. Yet, there is traction for convergence. eDiscoverya multi-billion-dollar industryis rapidly evolving, ready to embrace optimized solutions that strengthen cybersecurity (for cloud computing). Since the early 2000s, eDiscovery practitioners have developed skills and techniques that can be applied to information governance. Organizations can apply the lessons learned from eDiscovery to accelerate their path to a sophisticated information governance framework.\n",
      "The Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM) illustrates the relationship between key stakeholders and the Information Lifecycle and highlights the transparency required to enable effective governance. The updated IGRM v3.0 emphasizes that Privacy & Security Officers are essential stakeholders. This topic is addressed in an article entitled \"Better Ediscovery: Unified Governance and the IGRM,\" published by the American Bar Association.[31]\n",

      "Information Design\n",
      "Information designis the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters an efficient and effective understanding of the information. The term has come to be used for a specific area ofgraphic designrelated to displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field ofdata visualizationand is often taught as part of graphic design courses.[1]The broad applications of information design along with its close connections to other fields ofdesignand communication practices have created some overlap in the definitions ofcommunication design,data visualization, andinformation architecture.\n",
      "According toPer Mollerup, information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.[2]\n",
      "History\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The term 'information design' emerged as amultidisciplinaryarea of study in the 1970s. Use of the term is said to have started with graphic designers and it was solidified with the publication of theInformation Design Journalin 1979. Later, the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) was set up in 1987 andInformation Design Association(IDA) established in 1991.[3]In 1982,Edward Tufteproduced a book on information design calledThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information. The terminformation graphicstends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information, such as technical communicators and graphic designers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intechnical communication, information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practised on different scales.\n",
      "* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.\n",
      "* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.\n",
      "* On a small or detailed scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.\n",
      "There are many similarities between information design and information architecture. The title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites. The skillset of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of theinformation architectin the U.S. Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing web sites and digital media, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.\n",
      "Incomputer scienceandinformation technology, 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as)information architecture, the design ofinformation systems,databases, ordata structures. This sense includesdata modelingandprocess analysis.\n",
      "Early examples\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Charles Joseph Minard's 1861 diagram ofNapoleon's March- an early example of an information graphic.\n",
      "Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:\n",
      "* William Playfair'sline,bar,pie, andarea chartsillustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)[4][5]\n",
      "* John Snow's spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London[6]\n",
      "* Charles Joseph Minard's 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812[7]\n",
      "* W.E.B. Du Bois's data visualization on the lives of Black Americans for the 1900 World's Fair[8]\n",
      "* Otto Neurath'sInternational Picture Languageof the 1930s[9]\n",
      "* Florence Nightingale's information graphic depicting army mortality rates[10]\n",
      "The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 18121813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two-dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.Edward Tuftewrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"[5]\n",
      "Applications\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A visual definition ofDisability Adjusted Life YearVisualization of the frequency of outbound trains fromBangalore,India. Based on the work oftienne-Jules Marey\n",
      "Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).[11]The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies). The example of signs also highlights a niche category known aswayfinding.\n",
      "Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labelling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labelling. Examples of this are theTruth in Lending Actin the USA, which introduced theSchumer box(a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).\n",
      "ProfessorEdward Tufteexplained that users of information displays are executing particularanalytical taskssuch as making comparisons or determining causality. Thedesign principleof the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.[12]\n",
      "Simplicity\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity and understanding. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design:\n",
      "1. Tell the truth,\n",
      "2. Get to the point,\n",
      "3. Pick the right tool for the job,\n",
      "4. Highlight what is important,\n",
      "5. Of course, keep it simple.\n",
      "These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged.[13]\n",

      "Information governance\n",
      "Information governance, orIG, is the overall strategy for information at an organization. Information governance balances the risk that information presents with the value that information provides. Information governance helps with legal compliance, operational transparency, and reducing expenditures associated withlegal discovery. An organization can establish a consistent and logical framework for employees to handle data through their information governance policies and procedures. These policies guide proper behavior regarding how organizations and their employees handle information whether it is physically orelectronically.[1][2][3]\n",
      "Information governance encompasses more than traditionalrecords management. It incorporatesinformation securityand protection, compliance, data quality,data governance,electronic discovery,risk management, privacy, data storage and archiving,knowledge management, business operations and management, audit, analytics, IT management,master data management,enterprise architecture,business intelligence,big data,data science, and finance.[4]\n",
      "History\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Records management\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Records management deals with the creation, retention and storage and disposition of records. A record can either be a physical, tangible object, or digital information such as a database, application data, and e-mail. Thelifecyclewas historically viewed as the point of creation to the eventual disposal of a record. As data generation exploded in recent decades, and regulations and compliance issues increased, traditional records management failed to keep pace. A more comprehensive platform for managing records and information became necessary to address all phases of the lifecycle, which led to the advent of information governance.[5]\n",
      "In 2003 the Department of Health in England introduced the concept of broad-based information governance into the National Health Service, publishing version 1 of an online performance assessment tool with supporting guidance. The NHS IG Toolkit[6]is now used by over 30,000 NHS and partner organisations, supported by an e-learning platform with some 650,000 users. In 2010 Logan and Lomas took up the theme of IG more holistically, publishing on how different disciplines needed to come together to better manage information. Lomas produced teaching in this domain, with Smallwood later providing a key textbook in this domain.\n",
      "Professionally, in this context 2008,ARMA Internationalintroduced the Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles, or \"The Principles\" and in 2015 the subsequent \"The Principles\" Information Governance Maturity Model.[7]\"The Principles\" identify the critical hallmarks of information governance. As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use \"The Principles\" to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units. ARMA International recognized that a clear statement of \"Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles\" (\"The Principles\") would guide:\n",
      "* CEOs in determining how to protect their organizations in the use of information assets;\n",
      "* Legislators in crafting legislation meant to hold organizations accountable; and\n",
      "* Records management professionals in designing comprehensive and effective records management programs.\n",
      "Information governance goes beyond retention and disposition to include privacy, access controls, and other compliance issues. In electronic discovery, or e-discovery, relevant data in the form ofelectronically stored informationis searched for by attorneys and placed onlegal hold. IG includes consideration of how this data is held and controlled for e-discovery, and also provides a platform for defensible disposition and compliance. Additionally,metadataoften accompanies electronically stored data and can be of great value to the enterprise if stored and managed correctly.\n",
      "With all of these additional considerations that go beyond traditional records management, IG emerged as a platform for organizations to define policies at the enterprise level, across multiple jurisdictions. IG then also provides for the enforcement of these policies into the various repositories of information, data, and records.\n",
      "A coalition of organizations known as Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM), which was founded in 2005 to address issues related to electronic discovery and information governance, subsequently developed, as one of its projects, a resource called the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM).[8]In 2011, EDRM, in collaboration with ARMA International, published a white paper that describesHow the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM) Complements ARMA Internationals Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles (\"The Principles\")[9]The IGRM illustrates the relationship between key stakeholders and the Information Lifecycle and highlights the transparency required to enable effective governance IGRM v3.0 Update: Privacy & Security Officers As Stakeholders.[10]\n",
      "In 2012,Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council (CGOC)developed the Information Governance Process Maturity Model, or (IGPMM).[11]The model outlines 13 key processes inelectronic discovery (e-discovery)andinformation management. Each process is described in terms of a maturity level from one to four  completely manual and ad hoc to greater degrees of process integration across functions and automation.[12]In 2017, it was updated to include an emphasis on legal, privacy, information security, cloud security issues[13]and evolving data privacy concerns, including the impact ofThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)(EU).[11]\n",
      "Organizational structure\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In the past, records managers owned records management, perhaps within a compliance department at an enterprise. In order to address the broader issues surrounding records management, several other key stakeholders must be involved. Legal, IT, and Compliance tend to be the departments that touch information governance the most, though certainly other departments might seek representation. Many enterprises create information governance committees to ensure that all necessary constituents are represented and that all relevant issues are addressed.[14]\n",
      "Chief information governance officer\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Achief information governance officer(CIGO) is asenior executiveof a business, organization or government entity who oversees the management and coordination of all information on an enterprise-wide scale. Unlike achief marketing officerorchief technology officer, whose roles focus on narrower areas, the CIGO is in charge of implementing, facilitating, and improving information governance strategies across all facets of an organization. The CIGO helps other executives make decisions based on the values, costs, and risks associated with information.\n",
      "Evolution\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "In past decades, information governance responsibilities might have fallen under the purview of thechief information officer(CIO). But somewhere along the line, the CIO job description changed to focus solely on the information systems and associated technology that power a companynot the information itself.\n",
      "In today's age ofbig data, organizations have more information under their control than ever before.[15]To extract the maximum value from that data while simultaneously protecting an organization from its associated risks, business leaders have turned toward the CIGO because of the role's independence from other departments. CIGOs are tasked with neutrally balancing the needs of all departments with respect to an entire organization's top priorities.[16]\n",
      "Though the position is an emerging one, support for the CIGO continues to rise as business leaders increasingly understand the implications of information governance (and more importantly, the lack thereof). While many organizations have information governance projects in place, such initiatives are much more likely to succeed with top-down management.[17]\n",
      "Responsibilities\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Since the CIGO is a relatively new position, the role's responsibilities are not set in stone and continue to evolve. For the most part, today's CIGOs:\n",
      "* Manage all of an organization's information, tapping into as much value from it as possible (e.g., better-targeted marketing) while reducing exposure to its associated risks (e.g., lawsuits)\n",
      "* Coordinate information governance efforts across all stakeholders within an organization\n",
      "* Prioritize the information-related needs of all departments\n",
      "* Advocate for those needs on behalf of relevant stakeholders\n",
      "* Collaborate with the various information governance facets to continually improve processes\n",
      "* Identify and execute information-related synergies\n",
      "* Expunge non-critical data\n",
      "Tools\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "To address retention and disposition, Records Management and Enterprise Content Management applications were developed. Sometimes detached search engines or homegrown policy definition tools were created. These were often employed at a departmental or divisional level; rarely were tools used across the enterprise. While these tools were used to define policies, they lacked the ability to enforce those policies. Monitoring for compliance with policies was increasingly challenging. Since information governance addresses so much more than traditional records management, several software solutions have emerged to include the vast array of issues facing records managers.\n",

It must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society.\"[7]\n",

      "The first known usage of the term \"information science\" was in 1955.[8]An early definition of Information science (going back to 1968, the year when theAmerican Documentation Instituterenamed itself as theAmerican Society for Information Science and Technology) states:\n",
      "\"Information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization of information. This includes the authenticity of information representations in both natural and artificial systems, the use of codes for efficient message transmission, and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems. It is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, management, and other similar fields. It has both a pure science component, which inquires into the subject without regard to its application, and an applied science component, which develops services and products.\" (Borko 1968, p.3).[9]\n",
      "Related terms\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Some authors useinformaticsas a synonym forinformation science. This is especially true when related to the concept developed byA. I. Mikhailovand other Soviet authors in the mid-1960s. The Mikhailov school saw informatics as a discipline related to the study of scientific information.[10]Informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving andinterdisciplinarynature of the field. Definitions reliant on the nature of the tools used for deriving meaningful information from data are emerging in Informatics academic programs.[11]\n",
      "Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people[which?]note that much of what is called \"Informatics\" today was once called \"Information Science\"  at least in fields such asMedical Informatics. For example, when library scientists also began to use the phrase \"Information Science\" to refer to their work, the term \"informatics\" emerged:\n",
      "* in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that oflibrary science\n",
      "* in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems\n",
      "Another term discussed as a synonym for \"information studies\" is \"information systems\".Brian Campbell Vickery'sInformation Systems(1973) placed information systems within IS.[12]Ellis, Allen & Wilson (1999), on the other hand, provided a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between twodifferentfields: \"information science\" and \"information systems\".[13]\n",
      "Philosophy of information\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Philosophy of information\n",
      "Philosophy of information studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection ofpsychology,computer science,information technology, andphilosophy. It includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles ofinformation, including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences, as well as the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems.[14]Robert Hammarberg pointed out that there is no coherent distinction between information and data: \"an Information Processing System (IPS) cannot process data except in terms of whatever representational language is inherent to it, [so] data could not even be apprehended by an IPS without becoming representational in nature, and thus losing their status of being raw, brute, facts.\"[15]\n",
      "Ontology\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Ontology (information science)\n",
      "In science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within adomain, and the relationships between those concepts. It can be used toreasonabout the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain.\n",
      "More specifically, an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.[16]\n",

      "Information science, in studying the collection,classification, manipulation, storage,retrievaland dissemination ofinformationhas origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of theAssyrian Empirewith the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.[21]Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in thehistory of science, beginning with publication of the first issues ofPhilosophical Transactions,generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society.\n",
      "Theinstitutionalizationof science occurred throughout the 18th century. In 1731,Benjamin Franklinestablished theLibrary Company of Philadelphia, the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center ofscientific experimentation, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.[22]Benjamin Franklin invested a town inMassachusettswith a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the firstpublic libraryof theUnited States.[23]Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) publishedMemoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the firstmedical journal, in 1736. TheAmerican Philosophical Society, patterned on theRoyal Society(London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded,Alois Senefelderdeveloped the concept oflithographyfor use in mass printing work inGermanyin 1796.\n",

      "By the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801,Joseph Marie Jacquardinvented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of \"memory storage of patterns\" system.[24]As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s,[25]Charles Babbagedeveloped his \"difference engine\", the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his \"analytical engine\" by 1834. By 1843Richard Hoedeveloped the rotary press, and in 1844Samuel Morsesent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins theIndex to Periodical Literature,the first general periodical literature index in the US.\n",
      "In 1854George BoolepublishedAn Investigation into Laws of Thought...,which lays the foundations forBoolean algebra, which is later used ininformation retrieval.[26]In 1860 a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress did not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants returned home withStanislao Cannizzaro's outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.[27]\n",
      "By 1865, theSmithsonian Institutionbegan a catalog of current scientific papers, which became theInternational Catalogue of Scientific Papersin 1902.[28]The following year the Royal Society began publication of itsCatalogue of Papersin London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced thefirst practical typewriter. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875Frank Stephen Baldwinwas granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.[25]Alexander Graham BellandThomas Edisoninvented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and theAmerican Library Associationwas founded in Philadelphia. In 1879Index Medicuswas first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, withJohn Shaw Billingsas librarian, and later the library issuesIndex Catalogue,which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.[29]\n",
      "European documentation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The discipline ofdocumentation science, which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th century in Europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Many information science historians citePaul OtletandHenri La Fontaineas the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.[30]A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after theSecond World War, most notablySuzanne Briet.[31]However, \"information science\" as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th century.[32]\n",
      "Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, \"As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity  indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information.\"[32]Otlet and Lafontaine (who won theNobel Prizein 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information andinformation technologiesthat speaks directly to postwar visions of a global \"information society\". Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as theLeague of Nationsand theUnited Nations. Otlet designed theUniversal Decimal Classification, based onMelville Dewey's decimal classification system.[32]\n",
      "Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became theWorld Wide Web. His vision of a great network ofknowledgefocused ondocumentsand included the notions ofhyperlinks,search engines, remote access, andsocial networks.\n",
      "Otlet not only imagined that all the world's knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.[32]By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called theAmerican Society for Information Science and Technology.\n",

      "With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with other programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such aslawandmedicinein their curriculum.\n",
      "Among the individuals who had distinct opportunities to facilitate interdisciplinary activity targeted at scientific communication wasFoster E. Mohrhardt, director of theNational Agricultural Libraryfrom 1954 to 1968.[33]\n",
      "By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at theNational Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such asDialogandCompuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerousspecial interest groupsto respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.[34]\n",

With the advent of theinternet, and the explosion in popularity ofonline communities,social mediahas changed the information landscape in many respects, and creates both new modes of communication and new types of information\",[35]changing the interpretation of the definition of dissemination. The nature of social networks allows for faster diffusion of information than through organizational sources.[36]The internet has changed the way we view, use, create, and store information; now it is time to re-evaluate the way we share and spread it.\n",
      "Impact of social media on people and industry\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Social media networks provide an open information environment for the mass of people who have limited time or access to traditional outlets of information diffusion,[36]this is an \"increasingly mobile and social world [that] demands...new types of information skills\".[35]Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers. All major news providers have visibility and an access point through networks such asFacebookandTwittermaximizing their breadth of audience. Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. The ability to \"share, like, and comment on...content\"[37]increases the reach farther and wider than traditional methods. People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. Sharing through social media has become so influential that publishers must \"play nice\" if they desire to succeed. Although, it is often mutually beneficial for publishers and Facebook to \"share, promote and uncover new content\"[37]to improve both user base experiences. The impact of popular opinion can spread in unimaginable ways. Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools;The Wall Street Journaloffers an app through Facebook, andThe Washington Postgoes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in six months,[37]proving how interested people are in the new way of being provided information.\n",

The connections people have throughout the world enable the exchange of information at an unprecedented rate. It is for this reason that these networks have been realized for the potential they provide. \"Most news media monitor Twitter for breaking news\",[36]as well as news anchors frequently request the audience to tweet pictures of events.[37]The users and viewers of the shared information have earned \"opinion-making and agenda-setting power\"[36]This channel has been recognized for the usefulness of providing targeted information based on public demand.\n",

      "Information access is an area of research at the intersection ofInformatics, Information Science,Information Security,Language Technology, andComputer Science. The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users' access to it. What about assigning privileges and restricting access to unauthorized users? The extent of access should be defined in the level of clearance granted for the information. Applicable technologies includeinformation retrieval,text mining,text editing,machine translation, andtext categorisation. In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions oncopyright,patent law, andpublic domain. Public libraries need resources to provide knowledge of information assurance.\n",

This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance.\n",

      "Information retrieval (IR) is the area of study concerned with searching for documents, forinformationwithin documents, and formetadataabout documents, as well as that of searchingstructured storage,relational databases, and theWorld Wide Web. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called \"information overload\". Many universities andpublic librariesuse IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents.Web search enginesare the most visibleIR applications.\n",
      "An information retrieval process begins when a user enters aqueryinto the system. Queries are formal statements ofinformation needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees ofrelevancy.\n",
      "An object is an entity that is represented by information in adatabase. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on theapplicationthe data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,[40]audio,[41]mind maps[42]or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.\n",
      "Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.[43]\n",

      "Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians,[44]academics,[45]medical professionals,[46]engineers[47]and lawyers[48](among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to \"prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking\" (Leckie, Pettigrew & Sylvain 1996, p.188). The model has been adapted byWilkinson (2001)who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers. Recent studies in this topic address the concept of information-gathering that \"provides a broader perspective that adheres better to professionals' work-related reality and desired skills.\"[49](Solomon & Bronstein 2021).\n",

Theknowledge economyis its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes calleddigital citizens.\n",
      "Basically, an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another (Wark 1997, p.22). As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other.\n",

      "TheInformation Age[a]is ahistorical periodthat began in the mid-20th century. It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, as established during theIndustrial Revolution, to an economy centered oninformation technology.[2]The onset of the Information Age has been linked to the development of thetransistorin 1947.[2]This technological advance has had a significant impact on the way information is processed and transmitted.\n",
      "According to theUnited Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age was formed by capitalizing oncomputer miniaturizationadvances,[3]which led tomodernizedinformation systems and internet communications as the driving force ofsocial evolution.[4]\n",
      "There is ongoing debate concerning whether the Third Industrial Revolution has already ended, and if theFourth Industrial Revolutionhas already begun due to the recent breakthroughs in areas such asartificial intelligenceandbiotechnology.[5]This next transition has been theorized to harken the advent of theImagination Age, theInternet of things(IoT), and rapid advancements inmachine learning.\n",

      "The digital revolution converted technology from analog format to digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify thedigital signaland pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely. One turning point of the revolution was the change from analog to digitally recorded music.[6]During the 1980s the digital format of optical compact discs gradually replacedanalogformats, such asvinyl recordsandcassette tapes, as the popular medium of choice.[7]\n",
      "Previous inventions\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Humans have manufactured tools for counting and calculating since ancient times, such as theabacus,astrolabe,equatorium, and mechanical timekeeping devices. More complicated devices started appearing in the 1600s, including theslide ruleandmechanical calculators. By the early 1800s, theIndustrial Revolutionhad produced mass-market calculators like thearithmometerand the enabling technology of thepunch card.Charles Babbageproposed a mechanical general-purpose computer called theAnalytical Engine, but it was never successfully built, and was largely forgotten by the 20th century and unknown to most of the inventors of modern computers.\n",
      "TheSecond Industrial Revolutionin the last quarter of the 19th century developed useful electrical circuits and thetelegraph. In the 1880s,Herman Hollerithdeveloped electromechanical tabulating and calculating devices using punch cards andunit record equipment, which became widespread in business and government.\n",
      "Meanwhile, variousanalog computersystems used electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic systems to model problems and calculate answers. These included an 1872tide-predicting machine,differential analysers,perpetual calendarmachines, theDeltarfor water management in the Netherlands,network analyzersfor electrical systems, and various machines for aiming military guns and bombs. The construction of problem-specific analog computers continued in the late 1940s and beyond, withFERMIACfor neutron transport,Project Cyclonefor various military applications, and thePhillips Machinefor economic modeling.\n",
      "Building on the complexity of theZ1andZ2, German inventorKonrad Zuseused electromechanical systems to complete in 1941 theZ3, the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. Also during World War II, Allied engineers constructed electromechanicalbombesto break GermanEnigma machineencoding. The base-10 electromechanicalHarvard Mark Iwas completed in 1944, and was to some degree improved with inspiration from Charles Babbage's designs.\n",

      "In 1947, the first workingtransistor, thegermanium-basedpoint-contact transistor, was invented byJohn BardeenandWalter Houser Brattainwhile working underWilliam ShockleyatBell Labs.[8]This led the way to more advanceddigital computers. From the late 1940s, universities, military, and businesses developed computer systems to digitally replicate and automate previously manually performed mathematical calculations, with theLEObeing the first commercially available general-purpose computer.\n",
      "Digital communicationbecame economical for widespread adoption after the invention of the personal computer in the 1970s.Claude Shannon, aBell Labsmathematician, is credited for having laid out the foundations ofdigitalizationin his pioneering 1948 article,A Mathematical Theory of Communication.[9]\n",
      "In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Their concept, forms the basis of CMOS and DRAM technology today.[10]In 1957 at Bell Labs, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture planar silicon dioxide transistors,[11]later a team at Bell Labs demonstrated a working MOSFET.[12]The first integrated circuit milestone was achieved byJack Kilbyin 1958.[13]\n",
      "Other important technological developments included the invention of the monolithicintegrated circuitchip byRobert NoyceatFairchild Semiconductorin 1959,[14]made possible by theplanar processdeveloped byJean Hoerni.[15]In 1963,complementary MOS(CMOS) was developed byChih-Tang SahandFrank WanlassatFairchild Semiconductor.[16]Theself-aligned gatetransistor, which further facilitated mass production, was invented in 1966 by Robert Bower atHughes Aircraft[17][18]and independently by Robert Kerwin,Donald Kleinand John Sarace at Bell Labs.[19]\n",
      "In 1962 AT&T deployed theT-carrierfor long-haulpulse-code modulation(PCM) digital voice transmission. The T1 format carried 24 pulse-code modulated, time-division multiplexed speech signals each encoded in 64kbit/s streams, leaving 8kbit/s of framing information which facilitated the synchronization and demultiplexing at the receiver. Over the subsequent decades the digitisation of voice became the norm for all but the last mile (where analogue continued to be the norm right into the late 1990s).\n",
      "Following the development ofMOS integrated circuitchips in the early 1960s, MOS chips reached highertransistor densityand lower manufacturing costs thanbipolarintegrated circuits by 1964. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted byMoore's law, leading tolarge-scale integration(LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips tocomputingwas the basis for the firstmicroprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a completecomputer processorcould be contained on a single MOS LSI chip.[20]In 1968, Fairchild engineerFederico Fagginimproved MOS technology with his development of thesilicon-gateMOS chip, which he later used to develop theIntel 4004, the first single-chip microprocessor.[21]It was released byIntelin 1971, and laid the foundations for themicrocomputer revolutionthat began in the 1970s.\n",
      "MOS technology also led to the development of semiconductorimage sensorssuitable fordigital cameras.[22]The first such image sensor was thecharge-coupled device, developed byWillard S. BoyleandGeorge E. Smithat Bell Labs in 1969,[23]based onMOS capacitortechnology.[22]\n",

As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, thedata entry clerk. Culled from the ranks of secretaries and typists from earlier decades, the data entry clerk's job was to convert analog data (customer records, invoices, etc.) into digital data.\n",
      "In developed nations, computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools, homes, business, and industry.Automated teller machines,industrial robots,CGIin film and television,electronic music,bulletin board systems, and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s. Millions of people purchased home computers, making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such asApple, Commodore, and Tandy. To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time, having sold 17 million units (by some accounts)[29]between 1982 and 1994.\n",

In terms of capacity, there are two measures of importance: the number of operations a system can perform and the amount of information that can be stored. The number ofsynaptic operations per secondin a human brain has been estimated to lie between 10^15 and 10^17. While this number is impressive, even in 2007 humanity'sgeneral-purpose computerswere capable of performing well over 10^18 instructions per second.

      "During rare times in human history, there have been periods of innovation that have transformed human life. TheNeolithic Age, the Scientific Age and theIndustrial Ageall, ultimately, induced discontinuous and irreversible changes in the economic, social and cultural elements of the daily life of most people. Traditionally, these epochs have taken place over hundreds, or in the case of the Neolithic Revolution, thousands of years, whereas the Information Age swept to all parts of the globe in just a few years, as a result of the rapidly advancing speed of information exchange.\n",
      "Between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic period, humans began to domesticate animals, began to farm grains and to replace stone tools with ones made of metal. These innovations allowed nomadic hunter-gatherers to settle down. Villages formed along theYangtze Riverin China in 6,500 B.C., theNile Riverregion of Africa and inMesopotamia(Iraq) in 6,000 B.C. Cities emerged between 6,000 B.C. and 3,500 B.C. The development of written communication (cuneiforminSumeriaandhieroglyphsinEgyptin 3,500 B.C. and writing in Egypt in 2,560 B.C. and inMinoaand China around 1,450 B.C.) enabled ideas to be preserved for extended periods to spread extensively. In all, Neolithic developments, augmented by writing as an information tool, laid the groundwork for the advent of civilization.\n",
      "The Scientific Age began in the period betweenGalileo's 1543 proof that the planets orbit the Sun andNewton's publication of the laws of motion and gravity inPrincipiain 1697. This age of discovery continued through the 18th century, accelerated by widespread use of themoveable type printing pressbyJohannes Gutenberg.\n",
      "The Industrial Age began in Great Britain in 1760 and continued into the mid-19th century. The invention of machines such as the mechanical textile weaver by Edmund Cartwrite, the rotating shaftsteam enginebyJames Wattand thecotton ginbyEli Whitney, along with processes for mass manufacturing, came to serve the needs of a growing global population. The Industrial Age harnessed steam and waterpower to reduce the dependence on animal and human physical labor as the primary means of production. Thus, the core of the Industrial Revolution was the generation and distribution of energy from coal and water to produce steam and, later in the 20th century, electricity.\n",
      "The Information Age also requires electricity to power theglobal networksof computers that process and store data. However, what dramatically accelerated the pace of The Information Age's adoption, as compared to previous ones, was the speed by which knowledge could be transferred and pervaded the entire human family in a few short decades. This acceleration came about with the adoptions of a new form of power. Beginning in 1972, engineers devised ways to harness light to convey data throughfiber optic cable.Today, light-basedoptical networkingsystems at the heart of telecom networks and the Internet span the globe and carry most of the information traffic to and from users and data storage systems.\n",
      "Three stages of the Information Age\n",
      "There are different conceptualizations of the Information Age. Some focus on the evolution of information over the ages, distinguishing between the Primary Information Age and the Secondary Information Age. Information in the Primary Information Age was handled by newspapers, radio and television. The Secondary Information Age was developed by the Internet, satellite televisions andmobile phones. The Tertiary Information Age was emerged by media of the Primary Information Age interconnected with media of the Secondary Information Age as presently experienced.[71][72][73][74][75][76]\n",
      "Stages of development expressed as Kondratiev waves\n",
      "Others classify it in terms of the well-establishedSchumpeterianlong wavesorKondratiev waves. Here authors distinguish three different long-term metaparadigms, each with different long waves. The first focused on the transformation of material, includingstone,bronze, andiron. The second, often referred to asIndustrial Revolution, was dedicated to the transformation of energy, includingwater,steam,electric, andcombustion power. Finally, the most recent metaparadigm aims at transforming information. It started out with the proliferation of communication andstored dataand has now entered the age ofalgorithms, which aims at creating automated processes to convert the existing information into actionable knowledge.[77]\n",
      "Information in social and economic activities\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information.[78]Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as thePlatonic Academy,Aristotle's Peripatetic school in theLyceum, theMusaeumand theLibrary of Alexandria, or the schools ofBabylonian astronomy. TheAgricultural Revolutionand theIndustrial Revolutioncame up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.\n",
      "Information is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, includingShannon's (1949)Information Theory[79]andWiener's (1948)Cybernetics. Wiener stated: \"information is information not matter or energy\". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along withmatterand energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy.[80]By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\".[81]\n",
      "The theory of information revolution\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The terminformation revolutionmay relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms asIndustrial RevolutionandAgricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:[82][83]\n",
      "1. The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between matter, energy, and information. These apply both to the object of each economic activity, as well as within each economic activity or enterprise. For instance, an industry may process matter (e.g. iron) using energy and information (production and process technologies, management, etc.).\n",
      "2. Information is afactor of production(along withcapital,labor,land (economics)), as well as aproductsold in themarket, that is, acommodity. As such, it acquiresuse valueandexchange value, and therefore aprice.\n",
      "3. All products have use value, exchange value, and informational value. The latter can be measured by the information content of the product, in terms of innovation, design, etc.\n",
      "4. Industries develop information-generating activities, the so-calledResearch and Development(R&D) functions.\n",
      "5. Enterprises, and society at large, develop the information control and processing functions, in the form of management structures; these are also called \"white-collar workers\", \"bureaucracy\", \"managerial functions\", etc.\n",
      "6. Labor can be classified according to the object of labor, into information labor and non-information labor.\n",
      "7. Information activities constitute a large, new economic sector, the information sector along with the traditionalprimary sector,secondary sector, andtertiary sector, according to thethree-sector hypothesis. These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made byColin Clark(1940), who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary (agriculture, forestry, etc.) and secondary (manufacturing) sectors.[84]Thequaternary sectorand thequinary sector of the economyattempt to classify these new activities, but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme, although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the information sector.\n",
      "8. From a strategic point of view, sectors can be defined as information sector,means of production,means of consumption, thus extending the classicalRicardo-Marxmodel of theCapitalist mode of production(seeInfluences on Karl Marx).Marxstressed in many occasions the role of the \"intellectual element\" in production, but failed to find a place for it into his model.[85][86]\n",
      "9. Innovations are the result of the production of new information, as new products, new methods of production,patents, etc.Diffusion of innovationsmanifests saturation effects (related term:market saturation), following certain cyclical patterns and creating \"economic waves\", also referred to as \"business cycles\". There are various types of waves, such asKondratiev wave(54 years),Kuznets swing(18 years),Juglar cycle(9 years) andKitchin(about 4 years, see alsoJoseph Schumpeter) distinguished by their nature, duration, and, thus, economic impact.\n",
      "10. Diffusion of innovations causes structural-sectoral shifts in the economy, which can be smooth or can create crisis and renewal, a process whichJoseph Schumpetercalled vividly \"creative destruction\".\n",
      "From a different perspective,Irving E. Fang(1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the information highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.[87]\n",

      "These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work ofFritz Machlupwho in his (1962) book \"The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States\", claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.[89]\n",

      "Jobs and income distribution\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The Information Age has affected theworkforcein several ways, such as compelling workers to compete in a globaljob market. One of the most evident concerns is the replacement of human labor by computers that can do their jobs faster and more effectively, thus creating a situation in which individuals who perform tasks that can easily beautomatedare forced to find employment where their labor is not as disposable.[94]This especially creates issue for those inindustrial cities, where solutions typically involve loweringworking time, which is often highly resisted. Thus, individuals who lose their jobs may be pressed to move up into more indispensable professions (e.g. engineers,doctors, lawyers,teachers,professors, scientists,executives, journalists, consultants), who are able to compete successfully in theworld marketand receive (relatively) high wages.[citation needed]\n",
      "Along with automation, jobs traditionally associated with the middle class (e.g.assembly line,data processing, management, andsupervision) have also begun to disappear as result of outsourcing.[95]Unable to compete with those indeveloping countries,productionand service workers inpost-industrial (i.e. developed) societieseither lose their jobs through outsourcing, accept wage cuts, or settle forlow-skill,low-wageservice jobs.[95]In the past, the economic fate of individuals would be tied to that of their nation's. For example, workers in the United States were once well paid in comparison to those in other countries. With the advent of the Information Age and improvements in communication, this is no longer the case, as workers must now compete in a globaljob market, whereby wages are less dependent on the success or failure of individual economies.[95]\n",
      "In effectuating aglobalized workforce, the internet has just as well allowed for increased opportunity indeveloping countries, making it possible for workers in such places to provide in-person services, therefore competing directly with their counterparts in other nations. Thiscompetitive advantagetranslates into increased opportunities and higher wages.[96]\n",

      "The Information Age has affected the workforce in thatautomationand computerization have resulted in higherproductivitycoupled with netjob lossin manufacturing. In the United States, for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%.[97]Although it initially appeared thatjob lossin theindustrial sectormight be partially offset by the rapid growth of jobs in information technology, therecession of March 2001foreshadowed a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the sector. This pattern of decrease in jobs would continue until 2003,[98]and data has shown that, overall, technology creates more jobs than it destroys even in the short run.[99]\n",

      "Manuel Castells authoredThe Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture. He writes of our global interdependence and the new relationships between economy, state and society, what he calls \"a new society-in-the-making.\" He writes:\n",
      "\"It is in fact, quite the opposite: history is just beginning, if by history we understand the moment when, after millennia of a prehistoric battle with Nature, first to survive, then to conquer it, our species has reached the level of knowledge and social organization that will allow us to live in a predominantly social world. It is the beginning of a new existence, and indeed the beginning of a new age, The Information Age, marked by the autonomy of culture vis--vis the material basis of our existence.\"[133]\n",
      "Thomas Chatterton Williamswrote about the dangers ofanti-intellectualismin the Information Age in a piece forThe Atlantic. Although access to information has never been greater, most information is irrelevant or insubstantial. The Information Age's emphasis on speed over expertise contributes to \"superficial culture in which even the elite will openly disparage as pointless our main repositories for the very best that has been thought.\"[134]\n",

      "Information Ethics\n",
      "Information ethicshas been defined as \"the branch ofethicsthat focuses on the relationship between the creation, organization, dissemination, and use ofinformation, and the ethical standards and moral codes governing human conduct in society\".[1]It examines the morality that comes from information as a resource, a product, or as a target.[2]It provides a critical framework for considering moral issues concerning informationalprivacy, moral agency (e.g. whether artificial agents may be moral), new environmental issues (especially how agents should behave in theinfosphere), problems arising from the life-cycle (creation, collection, recording, distribution, processing, etc.) of information (especially ownership and copyright,digital divide, anddigital rights). It is very vital to understand that librarians, archivists, information professionals among others, really understand the importance of knowing how to disseminate proper information as well as being responsible with their actions when addressing information.[3]\n",
      "Information ethics has evolved to relate to a range of fields such ascomputer ethics,[4]medical ethics, journalism[5]and thephilosophy of information. As the use and creation of information and data form the foundation ofmachine learning,artificial intelligenceand many areas of mathematics, information ethics also plays a central role in theethics of artificial intelligence,big data ethicsandethics in mathematics.\n",
      "History\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The terminformation ethicswas first coined by Robert Hauptman and used in the bookEthical Challenges in Librarianship. The field of information ethics has a relatively short but progressive history having been recognized in the United States for nearly 20 years.[6]The origins of the field are in librarianship though it has now expanded to the consideration of ethical issues in other domains including computer science, the internet, media, journalism, management information systems, and business.[6]\n",
      "Evidence of scholarly work on this subject can be traced to the 1980s, when an article authored by Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim and published in theJournal of Information Science, discussed issues relating to the field including confidentiality, information biases, and quality control.[6]Another scholar, Robert Hauptman, has also written extensively about information ethics in the library field and founded theJournal of Information Ethicsin 1992.[7]\n",
      "One of the first schools to introduce an Information Ethics course was the University of Pittsburgh in 1990. The course was a master's level course on the concept of Information Ethics. Soon after, Kent State University also introduced a master's level course called \"Ethical Concerns For Library and Information Professionals.\" Eventually, the term \"Information Ethics\" became more associated with the computer science and information technology disciplines in university. Still however, it is uncommon for universities to devote entire courses to the subject. Due to the nature of technology, the concept of information ethics has spread to other realms in the industry. Thus, concepts such as \"cyberethics,\" a concept which discusses topics such as the ethics of artificial intelligence and its ability to reason, and media ethics which applies to concepts such as lies, censorship, and violence in the press. Therefore, due to the advent of the internet, the concept of information ethics has been spread to other fields other than librarianship now that information has become so readily available. Information has become more relevant now than ever now that the credibility of information online is more blurry than print articles due to the ease of publishing online articles. All of these different concepts have been embraced by the International Center for Information Ethics (ICIE), established by Rafael Capurro in 1999.[8]\n",
      "Dilemmas regarding the life of information are becoming increasingly important in a society that is defined as \"the information society\". The explosion of so much technology has brought information ethics to a forefront in ethical considerations. Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to ownership, access, privacy, security, and community. It is also concerned with relational issues such as \"the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information\".[9]\n",
      "Information technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security. Many of these issues are difficult or impossible to resolve due to fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditional Eastern cultures (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony).[10]The multi-faceted dispute betweenGoogleand the government of thePeople's Republic of Chinareflects some of these fundamental tensions.\n",
      "Professional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization's commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence \"personal decisions, professional practice, andpublic policy\".[11]Therefore, ethical analysis must provide a framework to take into consideration \"many, diverse domains\" (ibid.) regarding how information is distributed.\n",
      "Censorship\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Censorshipis an issue commonly involved in the discussion of information ethics because it describes the inability to access or express opinions or information based on the belief it is bad for others to view this opinion or information.[12]Sources that are commonly censored include books, articles, speeches, art work, data, music and photos.[12]Censorship can be perceived both as ethical and non-ethical in the field of information ethics.\n",
      "Those who believe censorship is ethical say the practice prevents readers from being exposed to offensive and objectionable material.[12]Topics such as sexism, racism, homophobia, and anti-semitism are present in public works and are widely seen as unethical in the public eye.[13]There is concern regarding the exposure of these topics to the world, especially the young generation.[13]The Australian Library Journal states proponents for censorship in libraries, the practice of librarians deciphering which books/ resources to keep in their libraries, argue the act of censorship is an ethical way to provide information to the public that is considered morally sound, allowing positive ethics instead of negative ethics to be dispersed.[13]According to the same journal, librarians have an \"ethical duty\" to protect the minds, particularly young people, of those who read their books through the lens of censorship to prevent the readers from adopting the unethical ideas and behaviors portrayed in the books.[13]\n",
      "However, others in the field of information ethics argue the practice of censorship is unethical because it fails to provide all available information to the community of readers. British philosopher John Stuart Mill argued censorship is unethical because it goes directly against the moral concept ofutilitarianism.[14]Mill believes humans are unable to have true beliefs when information is withheld from the population via censorship and acquiring true beliefs without censorship leads to greater happiness.[14]According to this argument, true beliefs and happiness (of which both concepts are considered ethical) cannot be obtained through the practice of censorship. Librarians and others who disperse information to the public also face the dilemma of the ethics of censorship through the argument that censorship harms students and is morally wrong because they are unable to know the full extent of knowledge available to the world.[13]The debate of information ethics in censorship was highly contested when schools removed information about evolution from libraries and curriculums due to the topic conflicting with religious beliefs.[13]In this case, advocates against ethics in censorship argue it is more ethical to include multiple sources information on a subject, such as creation, to allow the reader to learn and decipher their beliefs.[13]\n",
      "Ethics of downloading\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Illegal downloadinghas also caused some ethical concerns[15]and raised the question whetherdigital piracyis equivalent tostealingor not.[16][17]When asked the question \"Is it ethical to download copyrighted music for free?\" in a survey, 44 percent of a group of primarily college-aged students responded \"Yes.\"[18]\n",
      "Christian Barrybelieves that understanding illegal downloading as equivalent to common theft is problematic, because clear and morally relevant differences can be shown \"between stealing someones handbag and illegally downloading a television series\". On the other hand, he thinks consumers should try to respectintellectual propertyunless doing so imposes unreasonable cost on them.[19]\n",
      "In an article titled \"Download This Essay: A Defence of Stealing Ebooks\", Andrew Forcehimes argues that the way we think about copyrights is inconsistent, because every argument for (physical) public libraries is also an argument for illegally downloading ebooks and every argument against downloading ebooks would also be an argument against libraries.[20]In a reply,Sadulla Karjikerargues that \"economically, there is a material difference between permitting public libraries making physical books available and allowing such online distribution of ebooks.\"[21]Ali Pirhayati has proposed athought experimentbased on a high-tech library to neutralize the magnitude problem (suggested by Karjiker), and justify Forcehimes main idea.[22]\n",
      "Security and privacy\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Ethical concerns regarding international security, surveillance, and the right to privacy are on the rise.[23]The issues of security and privacy commonly overlap in the field of information, due to the interconnectedness of online research and the development ofInformation Technology (IT).[24]Some of the areas surrounding security and privacy areidentity theft, online economic transfers, medical records, and state security.[25]Companies, organizations, and institutions use databases to store, organize, and distribute user's informationwith or without their knowledge.[25]\n",
      "Individuals are far more likely to part with personal information when it seems that they will have some sort of control over the use of the information or if the information is given to an entity that they already have an established relationship with. In these specific circumstances, subjects will be much inclined to believe that their information has been collected for pure collection's sake. An entity may also be offering goods or services in exchange for the client's personal information. This type of collection method may seem valuable to a user due to the fact that the transaction appears to be free in the monetary sense. This forms a type of social contract between the entity offering the goods or services and the client. The client may continue to uphold their side of the contract as long as the company continues to provide them with a good or service that they deem worthy.[26]The concept of procedural fairness indicates an individual's perception of fairness in a given scenario. Circumstances that contribute to procedural fairness are providing the customer with the ability to voice their concerns or input, and control over the outcome of the contract.\n",
      "Best practice for any company collecting information from customers is to consider procedural fairness.[27]This concept is a key proponent of ethical consumer marketing and is the basis of United States Privacy Laws, the European Union's privacy directive from 1995, and the Clinton Administration's June 1995 guidelines for personal information use by all National Information Infrastructure participants.[28]An individual being allowed to remove their name from a mailing list is considered a best information collecting practice. In a few Equifax surveys conducted in the years 19941996, it was found that a substantial amount of the American public was concerned about business practices using private consumer information, and that is causes more harm than good.[29]Throughout the course of a customer-company relationship, the company can likely accumulate a plethora of information from its customer. With data processing technology flourishing, it allows for the company to make specific marketing campaigns for each of their individual customers.[26]Data collection and surveillance infrastructure has allowed companies to micro-target specific groups and tailor advertisements for certain populations.[30]\n",
      "Medical records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A recent trend of medical records is to digitize them. The sensitive information secured within medical records makes security measures vitally important.[31]The ethical concern of medical record security is great within the context of emergency wards, where any patient records can be accessed at all times.[31]Within an emergency ward, patient medical records need to be available for quick access; however, this means that all medical records can be accessed at any moment within emergency wards with or without the patient present.[31]\n",
      "Ironically, the donation of one's body organs \"to science\" is easier in most Western jurisdictions than donating one's medical records for research.[32]\n",
      "International security\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Warfare has also changed the security of countries within the 21st Century. After the events of 9-11 and other terrorism attacks on civilians, surveillance by states raises ethical concerns of the individual privacy of citizens. TheUSA PATRIOT Act 2001is a prime example of such concerns. Many other countries, especially European nations within the current climate of terrorism, is looking for a balancing between stricter security and surveillance, and not committing the same ethical concerns associated with the USA Patriot Act.[33]International security is moving to towards the trends of cybersecurity and unmanned systems, which involve the military application of IT.[23]Ethical concerns of political entities regardinginformation warfareinclude the unpredictability of response, difficulty differentiating civilian and military targets, and conflict between state and non-state actors.[23]\n",

      "Informationis anabstract conceptthat refers to something which has the powerto inform. At the most fundamental level, it pertains to theinterpretation(perhapsformally) of that which may besensed, or theirabstractions. Any natural process that is not completelyrandomand any observablepatternin anymediumcan be said to convey some amount of information. Whereasdigital signalsand otherdatause discretesignsto convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such asanalogue signals,poems,pictures,musicor othersounds, andcurrentsconvey information in a more continuous form.[1]Information is notknowledgeitself, but themeaningthat may be derived from arepresentationthrough interpretation.[2]\n",
      "The concept ofinformationis relevant or connected to various concepts,[3]includingconstraint,communication,control,data,form,education,knowledge,meaning,understanding,mental stimuli,pattern,perception,proposition,representation, andentropy.\n",
      "Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step areprocessedinto information to be interpreted and processed at the next step. For example, inwritten texteachsymbolorletterconveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a givendomain. In adigital signal,bitsmay be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up. The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing.\n",
      "The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution ofambiguityoruncertaintythat arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message.[4]\n",
      "Information may be structured asdata. Redundant data can becompressedup to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression.\n",
      "The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis. For example, a restaurant collects data from every customer order. That information may be analyzed to produce knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently wants to identify the most popular or least popular dish.[citation needed]\n",
      "Information can be transmitted in time, viadata storage, and space, viacommunicationandtelecommunication.[5]Information is expressed either as the content of amessageor through direct or indirectobservation. That which isperceivedcan be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\n",
      "Information can beencodedinto various forms fortransmissionandinterpretation(for example, information may be encoded into asequenceofsigns, or transmitted via asignal). It can also beencryptedfor safe storage and communication.\n",
      "The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is proportional to the negative logarithm of the probability of occurrence.Information theorytakes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. Thebitis a typicalunit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'.[6]Other units such as thenatmay be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011Sciencearticle estimates that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digitalbitsin 2007 and that the year 2002 was the beginning of thedigital agefor information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analogue for the first time).[7]\n",
      "Etymology\n",
      "See also:History of the word and concept \"information\"\n",
      "The English word \"information\" comes from Middle Frenchenformacion/informacion/information'a criminal investigation' and its etymon, Latininformati?(n)'conception, teaching, creation'.[8]\n",
      "In English, \"information\" is an uncountablemass noun.\n",
      "Information theory\n",
      "Main article:Information theory\n",
      "Information theory is the scientific study of thequantification,storage, andcommunicationof information. The field itself was fundamentally established by the work ofClaude Shannonin the 1940s, with earlier contributions byHarry NyquistandRalph Hartleyin the 1920s.[9][10]The field is at the intersection ofprobability theory,statistics, computer science,statistical mechanics,information engineering, andelectrical engineering.\n",
      "A key measure in information theory isentropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of arandom variableor the outcome of arandom process. For example, identifying the outcome of a faircoin flip(with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of adie(with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory aremutual information, channel capacity,error exponents, andrelative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory includesource coding,algorithmic complexity theory,algorithmic information theory, andinformation-theoretic security.\n",
      "There is another opinion regarding the universal definition of information. It lies in the fact that the concept itself has changed along with the change of various historical epochs, and to find such a definition, it is necessary to find standard features and patterns of this transformation. For example, researchers in the field of information Petrichenko E. A. and Semenova V. G., based on a retrospective analysis of changes in the concept of information, give the following universal definition: \"Information is a form of transmission of human experience (knowledge).\" In their opinion, the change in the essence of the concept of information occurs after various breakthrough technologies for the transfer of experience (knowledge), i.e. the appearance of writing, the printing press, the first encyclopedias, the telegraph, the development of cybernetics, the creation of a microprocessor, the Internet, smartphones, etc. Each new form of experience transfer is a synthesis of the previous ones. That is why we see such a variety of definitions of information, because, according to the law of dialectics \"negation-negation\", all previous ideas about information are contained in a \"filmed\" form and in its modern representation.[11]\n",
      "Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression(e.g. forZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction(e.g. forDSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of theVoyagermissions to deep space, the invention of thecompact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas, includingstatistical inference,[12]cryptography,neurobiology,[13]perception,[14]linguistics, the evolution[15]and function[16]of molecular codes (bioinformatics),thermal physics,[17]quantum computing,black holes,information retrieval,intelligence gathering,plagiarism detection,[18]pattern recognition,anomaly detection[19]and even art creation.\n",
      "As sensory input\n",
      "Often information can be viewed as a type of input to anorganismorsystem. Inputs are of two kinds. Some inputs are important to the function of the organism (for example, food) or system (energy) by themselves. In his bookSensory Ecology[20]biophysicistDavid B. Dusenberycalled these causal inputs. Other inputs (information) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used topredictthe occurrence of a causal input at a later time (and perhaps another place). Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input.\n",
      "In practice, information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system. For example, light is mainly (but not only, e.g. plants can grow in the direction of the light source) a causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information. The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee's nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower, where the bee often finds nectar or pollen, which are causal inputs, a nutritional function.\n",
      "As representation and complexity\n",
      "Thecognitive scientistand applied mathematician Ronaldo Vigo argues that information is a concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense. These are, any dimensionally defined category of objects S, and any of its subsets R. R, in essence, is a representation of S, or, in other words, conveys representational (and hence, conceptual) information about S. Vigo then defines the amount of information that R conveys about S as the rate of change in thecomplexityof S whenever the objects in R are removed from S. Under \"Vigo information\", pattern, invariance, complexity, representation, and information five fundamental constructs of universal science are unified under a novel mathematical framework.[21][22][23]Among other things, the framework aims to overcome the limitations ofShannon-Weaver informationwhen attempting to characterize and measure subjective information.\n",
      "As an influence that leads to transformation\n",
      "Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns.[24][25]In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example,DNA. The sequence ofnucleotidesis a pattern that influences the formation and development of anorganismwithout any need for a conscious mind. One might argue though that for a human to consciously define a pattern, for example a nucleotide, naturally involves conscious information processing. However, the existence ofunicellularandmulticellularorganisms, with the complexbiochemistrythat leads, among other events, to the existence ofenzymesand polynucleotides that interact maintaining the biological order and participating in the development of multicellular organisms, precedes by millions of years the emergence of human consciousness and the creation of the scientific culture that produced the chemical nomenclature.\n",
      "Systems theoryat times seems to refer to information in this sense, assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind, and patterns circulating (due tofeedback) in the system can be called information. In other words, it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation, though not created or presented for that purpose. For example,Gregory Batesondefines \"information\" as a \"difference that makes a difference\".[26]\n",
      "If, however, the premise of \"influence\" implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specificcontextassociated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information intoknowledge. Complex definitions of both \"information\" and \"knowledge\" make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of \"transformation\" is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge, especially in the business discipline ofknowledge management. In this practice, tools and processes are used to assist aknowledge workerin performing research and making decisions, including steps such as:\n",
      "* Review information to effectively derive value and meaning\n",
      "* Referencemetadataif available\n",
      "* Establishrelevantcontext, often from many possible contexts\n",
      "* Derive new knowledge from the information\n",
      "* Make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge\n",
      "Stewart (2001) argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical, lying at the core of value creation andcompetitive advantagefor the modern enterprise.\n",
      "In a biological framework, Mizraji[27]has described information as an entity emerging from the interaction of patterns with receptor systems (eg: in molecular or neural receptors capable of interacting with specific patterns, information emerges from those interactions). In addition, he has incorporated the idea of \"information catalysts\", structures where emerging information promotes the transition from pattern recognition to goal-directed action (for example, the specific transformation of a substrate into a product by an enzyme, or auditory reception of words and the production of an oral response)\n",
      "The Danish Dictionary of Information Terms[28]argues that information only provides an answer to a posed question. Whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person. So a generalized definition of the concept should be: \"Information\" = An answer to a specific question\".\n",
      "WhenMarshall McLuhanspeaks ofmediaand their effects on human cultures, he refers to the structure ofartifactsthat in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets. Also,pheromonesare often said to be \"information\" in this sense.\n",

      "These sections are using measurements of data rather than information, as information cannot be directly measured.\n",
      "As of 2007\n",
      "It is estimated that the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed)exabytesin 1986  which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MBCD-ROMper person (539 MB per person)  to 295 (optimally compressed)exabytesin 2007.[7]This is the informational equivalent of almost 61CD-ROMper person in 2007.[5]\n",

      "Records are specialized forms of information. Essentially, records are information produced consciously or as by-products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value. Primarily, their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value. Soundrecords managementensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required.[citation needed]\n",
      "The international standard on records management, ISO 15489, defines records as \"information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business\".[31]The International Committee on Archives (ICA) Committee on electronic records defined a record as, \"recorded information produced or received in the initiation, conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content, context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity\".[32]\n",
      "Records may be maintained to retaincorporate memoryof the organization or to meet legal, fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization. Willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered \"...six key requirements for goodcorporate governance...transparency; accountability; due process; compliance; meeting statutory and common law requirements; and security of personal and corporate information.\"[33]\n",
      "Semiotics\n",
      "Michael Bucklandhas classified \"information\" in terms of its uses: \"information as process\", \"information as knowledge\", and \"information as thing\".[34]\n",
      "Beynon-Davies[35][36]explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems. Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels, layers or branches ofsemiotics: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics. These four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other.\n",
      "Pragmaticsis concerned with the purpose of communication. Pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used. The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour. In other words, pragmatics link language to action.\n",
      "Semanticsis concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act. Semantics considers the content of communication. Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs  the association between signs and behaviour. Semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts  particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior.\n",
      "Syntaxis concerned with the formalism used to represent a message. Syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems.\n",
      "Nielsen (2008) discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries. He introduces the concept oflexicographic information costsand refers to the effort a user of a dictionary must make to first find, and then understand data so that they can generate information.\n",
      "Communication normally exists within the context of some social situation. The social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed (pragmatics) and the form of communication. In a communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter-related signs taken from a language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication. Mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax and semantics. The sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel (empirics). The chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place, and over what distance.\n",
      "Physics and determinacy\n",
      "The existence of information about aclosed systemis a major concept in bothclassical physicsandquantum mechanics, encompassing the ability, real or theoretical, of an agent to predict the future state of a system based on knowledge gathered during its past and present.Determinismis a philosophical theory holding that causal determination can predict all future events,[37]positing a fully predictableuniversedescribed by classical physicistPierre-Simon Laplaceas \"the effect of its past and the cause of its future\".[38]\n",
      "Quantum physics instead encodes information as awave function, which prevents observers from directly identifying all of its possiblemeasurements. Prior to the publication ofBell's theorem, determinists reconciled with this behavior usinghidden variable theories, which argued that the information necessary to predict the future of a functionmustexist, even if it is not accessible for humans; A view surmised byAlbert Einsteinwith the assertion that \"God does not play dice\".[39]\n",
      "Modernastronomycites the mechanical sense of information in theblack hole information paradox, positing that, because the complete evaporation of ablack holeintoHawking radiationleaves nothing except an expanding cloud ofhomogeneousparticles, this results in the irrecoverability of any information about the matter to have originally crossed theevent horizon, violating both classical and quantum assertions against the ability to destroy information.[40][41]\n",
      "The application of information study\n",
      "The information cycle (addressed as a whole or in its distinct components) is of great concern toinformation technology,information systems, as well asinformation science. These fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture (throughsensors) and generation (throughcomputation,formulationor composition),processing(including encoding, encryption, compression, packaging),transmission(including alltelecommunicationmethods), presentation (includingvisualization/displaymethods),storage(such as magnetic or optical, includingholographic methods), etc.\n",

      "Knowledge management(KM) is the set of procedures for producing, disseminating, utilizing, and overseeing an organization's knowledge and data. It alludes to a multidisciplinary strategy that maximizes knowledge utilization to accomplish organizational goals. Courses in business administration, information systems, management, libraries, and information science are all part of knowledge management, a discipline that has been around since 1991. Information and media, computer science, public health, and public policy are some of the other disciplines that may contribute to KM research. Numerous academic institutions provide master's degrees specifically focused on knowledge management. As a component of their IT, human resource management, or business strategy departments, many large corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations have resources devoted to internal knowledge management initiatives. These organizations receive KM guidance from a number of consulting firms. Organizational goals including enhanced performance, competitive advantage, innovation, sharing of lessons learned, integration, and ongoing organizational improvement are usually the focus of knowledge management initiatives. These initiatives are similar to organizational learning, but they can be differentiated by their increased emphasis on knowledge management as a strategic asset and information sharing. Organizational learning is facilitated by knowledge management. The setting ofsupply chainmay be the most challenging situation for knowledge management since it involves several businesses without a hierarchy or ownership tie; some authors refer to this type of knowledge as transorganizational or interorganizational knowledge.industry 4.0(or4th industrial revolution) anddigital transformationalso add to that complexity, as new issues arise from the volume and speed of information flows and knowledge generation.\n",
      "History\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Knowledge management efforts have a long history, including on-the-job discussions, formalapprenticeship,discussion forums, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs.[1][2]With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific adaptations of technologies such asknowledge bases,expert systems,information repositories, groupdecision support systems,intranets, andcomputer-supported cooperative workhave been introduced to further enhance such efforts.[1]\n",
      "In 1999, the termpersonal knowledge managementwas introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level.[3]\n",
      "In the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy,processandmeasurement.[4][5]Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination and application; cognitive, social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement,benchmarkingand incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change.[5]In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete and action-orientated.\n",
      "TheISO 9001:2015 quality management standardreleased in September 2015 introduced a specification for 'organizational knowledge' as a complementary aspect of quality management within an organisation.[6]\n",
      "Research\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s.[7]It was initially supported by individual practitioners, whenSkandiahired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's firstchief knowledge officer(CKO).[8]Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly ofCIBC, Canada), started investigating KM long before that.[1]The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organizations.[1]Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed.[9]The KM idea has been taken up by academics, such asIkujiro Nonaka(Hitotsubashi University), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Hitotsubashi University),Thomas H. Davenport(Babson College) and Baruch Lev (New York University).[10][11]\n",
      "In 2001,Thomas A. Stewart, former editor atFortunemagazine and subsequently the editor ofHarvard Business Review, published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organizations.[12]The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity.[1]First, is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; single-author publications are less common. Second, the role of practitioners has changed.[9]Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009.[13]Third, the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing, currently reaching 27 outlets.[14][15]\n",
      "Multiple KM disciplines exist; approaches vary by author and school.[9][16]As the discipline matured, academic debates increased regardingtheoryand practice, including:\n",
      "* Techno-centric with a focus on technology, ideally those that enhanceknowledge sharingand creation.[17][18]\n",
      "* Organisational with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best.[19]\n",
      "* Ecologicalwith a focus on the interaction of people,identity, knowledge, and environmental factors as acomplex adaptive systemakin to a naturalecosystem.[20][21]\n",
      "Regardless of theschool of thought, core components of KM roughly include people/culture, processes/structure and technology. The details depend on theperspective.[22]KM perspectives include:\n",
      "* community of practice[23]\n",
      "* social network analysis[24]\n",
      "* intellectual capital[25]\n",
      "* information theory[7][8]\n",
      "* complexity science[26]\n",
      "* constructivism[27][28]\n",
      "The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned[29]withaction researchsuggested as having more relevance[30]and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice.[4]\n",
      "Dimensions\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Differentframeworksfor distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist.[2]One proposed framework for categorising the dimensions of knowledge distinguishestacit knowledgeandexplicit knowledge.[26]Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as to accomplish particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others.[9][31]\n",
      "The Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka & Takeuchi\n",
      "Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model (SECI, for Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, Internalisation) which considers a spiraling interaction betweenexplicit knowledgeand tacit knowledge.[32]In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge.[32]\n",
      "Hayes and Walsham (2003) describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives.[33]The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored; because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed.[33]\n",
      "Early research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort.[19][34]\n",
      "Subsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory.[3]Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e.,symbolsoutside our heads).[3][35]More recently, together withGeorg von KroghandSven Voelpel, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward.[36][37]\n",
      "A second proposed framework for categorising knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of asystemoutside a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) fromembodied knowledgerepresenting a learned capability of a human body'snervousandendocrine systems.[38]\n",
      "A third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" (i.e., innovation) vs. thetransferor exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group, organisation, or community.[33][39]Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use ofsocial computingtools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer.[39]\n",
      "Strategies\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Knowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities.[25]Organisations have tried knowledge captureincentives, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards intoperformance measurementplans.[40]Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged.[41]\n",
      "One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy).[41][42]In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as adatabase, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification).[42]Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy).[41][42]In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide insights to requestor (personalisation).[26]When talking about strategic knowledge management, the form of the knowledge and activities to share it defines the concept between codification and personalization.[43]The form of the knowledge means that it's eithertacitorexplicit.Dataandinformationcan be considered as explicit andknow-howcan be considered as tacit.[44]\n",
      "Hansenet al. defined the two strategies (codification and personalisation).[45]Codification means a system-oriented method in KM strategy for managing explicit knowledge with organizational objectives.[46]Codification strategy is document-centered strategy, where knowledge is mainly codified as \"people-to-document\" method. Codification relies on information infrastructure, where explicit knowledge is carefully codified and stored.[45]Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible.[47]Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge.[48]In contrast, personalisation encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly.[47]Personification means human-oriented KM strategy where the target is to improve knowledge flows through networking and integrations related to tacit knowledge with knowledge sharing and creation.[46]Information technology plays a less important role, as it only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing.\n",
      "Generic knowledge strategies includeknowledge acquisitionstrategy, knowledge exploitation strategy, knowledge exploration strategy, andknowledge sharingstrategy. These strategies aim at helping organisations to increase their knowledge andcompetitive advantage.[49]\n",
      "Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:[41][20][26]\n",
      "* Knowledge sharing(fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information, based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant)\n",
      "* Make knowledge-sharing a key role in employees' job description\n",
      "* Inter-project knowledge transfer\n",
      "* Intra-organisational knowledge sharing\n",
      "* Inter-organisational knowledge sharing\n",
      "* Knowledge retention also known as Knowledge Continuation: activities addressing the challenge of knowledge loss as a result of people leaving[50][51][52]\n",
      "* Mapping knowledge competencies, roles and identifying current or future predicted gaps.\n",
      "* Defining for each chosen role the main knowledge that should be retained, and building rituals in which the knowledge is documented or transferred on, from the day they start their job.\n",
      "* Transfer of knowledge and information prior to employee departure by means of sharing documents, shadowing, mentoring, and more,\n",
      "* Proximity & architecture (the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing)\n",
      "* Storytelling(as a means of transferring tacit knowledge)\n",
      "* Cross-project learning\n",
      "* After-action reviews\n",
      "* Knowledge mappingrequires the organization to know what kind of knowledge organization it has, how it is distributed throughout the company, and how to efficiently use and re-use that knowledge. (a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all)\n",
      "* Communities of practice\n",
      "* Expert directories (to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts)\n",
      "* Expert systems(knowledge seeker responds to one or more specific questions to reach knowledge in a repository)\n",
      "* Best practicetransfer\n",
      "* Knowledge fairs\n",
      "* Competency-based management (systematic evaluation and planning of knowledge related competences of individual organisation members)\n",
      "* Masterapprentice relationship, Mentor-mentee relationship,job shadowing\n",
      "* Collaborative softwaretechnologies (wikis, shared bookmarking, blogs,social software, etc.)\n",
      "* Knowledge repositories (databases,bookmarking engines, etc.)\n",
      "* Measuring and reportingintellectual capital(a way of making explicit knowledge for companies)\n",
      "* Knowledge brokers(some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific \"field\" and act as first reference on a specific subject)\n",
      "* Knowledge farming(usingnote-takingsoftware to cultivate aknowledge graph, part ofknowledge agriculture)\n",
      "* Knowledge capturing (refers to a process where trained people extract valuable or else desired knowledge from experts and embed it in databases)\n",
      "Motivations\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Multiple motivations lead organisations to undertake KM.[31]Typical considerations include:[26][53]\n",
      "* Making available increased knowledge content in thedevelopmentand provision ofproductsandservices\n",
      "* Achieving shorter development cycles\n",
      "* Improving consistency of knowledge and standardized expert skills among staff\n",
      "* Facilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning\n",
      "* Leveragingexpertiseacross the organisation\n",
      "* Increasingnetworkconnectivitybetween internal and external individuals\n",
      "* Managing business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and ideas appropriate to their work\n",
      "* Solving intractable orwicked problems\n",
      "* Managing intellectual capital and assets in the workforce (such as the expertise andknow-howpossessed by key individuals or stored in repositories)\n",
      "KM technologies\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Knowledge management (KM) technology can be categorised:\n",
      "* Collaborative software(Groupware)Software that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organisational information. Such applications provide tools forthreaded discussions,document sharing, organisation-wide uniform email, and other collaboration-related features.\n",
      "* Workflow systemsSystems that allow the representation of processes associated with the creation, use and maintenance of organisational knowledge, such as the process of creating and utilise forms and documents.\n",
      "* Content managementanddocument managementsystemsSoftware systems that automate the process of creating web content and/or documents. Roles such as editors, graphic designers, writers and producers can be explicitly modeled along with the tasks in the process and validation criteria. Commercial vendors started either to support documents or to support web content but as the Internet grew these functions merged and vendors now perform both functions.\n",
      "* Enterprise portalsSoftware that aggregates information across the entire organisation or for groups such as project teams.\n",
      "* eLearningSoftware that enables organisations to create customised training and education. This can include lesson plans, monitoring progress and online classes.\n",
      "* Planning andscheduling softwareSoftware that automates schedule creation and maintenance. The planning aspect can be integrated withproject management software.[17]\n",
      "* TelepresenceSoftware that enables individuals to have virtual \"face-to-face\" meetings without assembling at one location. Videoconferencing is the most obvious example.\n",
      "* Semantic technologysuch asontologiesSystems that encode meaning alongside data to give machines the ability to extract and infer information.[54]\n",
      "These categories overlap. Workflow, for example, is a significant aspect of content or document management systems, most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals.[41][55]\n",
      "Proprietary KM technology products such asHCL Notes(Previously Lotus Notes) defined proprietary formats for email, documents, forms, etc. The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats.Open-sourceandfreewaretools for the creation ofblogsandwikisnow enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools.[30][56]\n",
      "KM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level,[57]as part of theSemantic Web.[58]Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption,[59][60][61]while other commentators have argued that it has been a success.[62]\n",
      "Knowledge barriers\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Just like knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing, the term \"knowledge barriers\" is not a uniformly defined term and differs in its meaning depending on the author.[63]Knowledge barriers can be associated with high costs for both companies and individuals.[64][65][66]Knowledge barriers appear to have been used from at least three different perspectives in the literature:[63]1) Missing knowledge about something as a result of barriers for the share or transfer of knowledge. 2) Insufficient knowledge based on the amount of education in a certain field or issue. 3) A unique individual or group of humans' perceptual system lacks adequate contact points or does not fit incoming information to use and transform it to knowledge.\n",
      "Knowledge retention\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Knowledge retention is part of knowledge management. It helps convert tacit form of knowledge into an explicit form. It is a complex process which aims to reduce the knowledge loss in the organization.[67]Knowledge retention is needed when expert knowledge workers leave the organization after a long career.[68]Retaining knowledge prevents losing intellectual capital.[69]\n",
      "According to DeLong(2004)[70]knowledge retention strategies are divided into four main categories:\n",
      "* Human resources, processes and practices\n",
      "* Knowledge transfer practices\n",
      "* Knowledge recovery practices\n",
      "* Information technologies used to capture, store and share knowledge.\n",
      "Knowledge retention projects are usually introduced in three stages: decision making, planning and implementation. There are differences among researchers on the terms of the stages. For example, Dalkir talks about knowledge capture, sharing and acquisition and Doan et al. introduces initiation, implementation and evaluation.[71][72]Furthermore, Levy introduces three steps (scope, transfer, integration) but also recognizes a \"zero stage\" for initiation of the project.[68]\n",
      "Knowledge audit\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A knowledge audit is a comprehensive assessment of an organization's knowledge assets, including its explicit and tacit knowledge, intellectual capital, expertise, and skills. The goal of a knowledge audit is to identify the organization's knowledge strengths and gaps, and to develop strategies for leveraging knowledge to improve performance and competitiveness. Knowledge audit helps ensure that an organization's knowledge management activities are heading in the right direction. It also reduces the making of incorrect decisions. Term knowledge audit is often used interchangeably with information audit, although information audit is slightly narrower in scope.[73][74]\n",
      "The requirement and significance of a knowledge audit can vary widely among different industries and companies. For instance, within the software development industry, knowledge audits can play a pivotal role due to the inherently knowledge-intensive nature of the work. This contrasts with sectors like manufacturing, where physical assets often take more important role. The difference arises from the fact that in software development companies, the skills, expertise, and intellectual capital, often overshadow the value of physical assets.[75]\n",
      "Knowledge audits provide opportunities for organizations to improve their management of knowledge assets, with the goal of enhancing organizational effectiveness and efficiency. By conducting a knowledge audit, organizations can raise awareness of knowledge assets as primary factors of production and as critical capital assets in today's knowledge economy. The process of a knowledge audit allows organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their knowledge assets. This includes identifying and defining these assets, understanding their behavior and properties, and describing how, when, why, and where they are used in business processes.[75]\n",
      "Knowledge protection\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Knowledge protection refers to behaviors and actions taken to protect the knowledge from unwanted opportunistic behavior for example appropriation or imitation of the knowledge.[76]\n",
      "Knowledge protection is used to prevent the knowledge to be unintentionally available or useful for competitors. Knowledge protection can be for example a patent, copyright, trademark, lead time or secrecy held by a company or an individual.[77]\n",
      "Knowledge protection methods\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "There are various methods for knowledge protection and those methods are often divided into two categories by their formality: formal protection and informal protection.[78][79][80][81]Occasionally a third category is introduced, semi-formal protection, which includes contracts and trade-secrets.[80][81][82] These semi-formal methods are also usually placed under formal methods.\n",
      "Organizations often use a combination of formal and informal knowledge protection methods to achieve comprehensive protection of their knowledge assets.[81]The formal and informal knowledge protection mechanisms are different in nature, and they have their benefits and drawbacks. In many organizations, the challenge is to find a good mix of measures that works for the organization.[79]\n",
      "Formal methods\n",

      "Formal knowledge protection practices can take various forms, such as legal instruments or formal procedures and structures, to control which knowledge is shared and which is protected.[78]Formal knowledge protection methods include for example: patents, trademarks, copyrights and licensing.[78][80][83]\n",
      "Technical solutions to protect the knowledge fall also under the category of formal knowledge protection. Formal knowledge protection from technical viewpoint includes technical access constraints and protection of communication channels, systems, and storage.[79]\n",
      "While knowledge may eventually become public in some form or another, formal protection mechanisms are necessary to prevent competitors from directly utilizing it for their own gain.[79]Formal protection methods are particularly effective in protecting established knowledge that can be codified and embodied in final products or services.[83]\n",
      "Informal methods\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Informal knowledge protection methods refer to the use of informal mechanisms such as human resource management practices or secrecy to protect knowledge assets. There is notable amount of knowledge that cannot be protected by formal methods, and for which more informal protection might be the most efficient option.[84]\n",
      "Informal knowledge protection methods can take various forms, such as: secrecy, social norms and values, complexity, lead-time and Human resource management.[78][83][85][84]\n",
      "Informal knowledge protection methods protect knowledge assets for example by making it difficult for outsiders to access and understand the knowledge within the boundaries of the organization.[85]Informal protection methods are more effective for protecting knowledge that is complex or difficult to express, articulate, or codify.[85][84]\n",
      "Balancing knowledge protection and knowledge sharing\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a critical dilemma faced by organizations today.[86][79]While sharing knowledge can lead to innovation, collaboration, and competitive advantage, protecting knowledge can prevent it from being misused, misappropriated, or lost.[86][79][87]Thus, the need for organizational learning must be balanced with the need to protect organisations' intellectual property, especially whilst cooperating with external partners.[86][88]The role of information security is crucial in helping organisations protect their assets whilst still enabling the benefits of information sharing.[79][87]By implementing effective knowledge management strategies, organizations can protect valuableintellectual propertywhile also encouraging the sharing of relevant knowledge across teams and departments.[86]This active balancing act requires careful consideration of factors such as the level of openness, the identification of core knowledge areas, and the establishment of appropriate mechanisms for knowledge transfer and collaboration.[86]Finding the right balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of the trade-off's involved and the context in which knowledge is shared or protected.[86][88]\n",
      "Knowledge protection risks\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Protecting knowledge cannot be considered without its risks. Here are listed four of the major risks associated with knowledge protection:\n",
      "* Overprotection: One of the major risks of knowledge protection is overprotection. Overprotection occurs when intellectual property rights are too broad or too strict, preventing others from building upon existing ideas and stifling innovation. As noted by Rouyre and Fernandez,[89]overprotection can have a chilling effect on follow-on innovation, which is particularly problematic in fields where innovation is cumulative.\n",
      "* Misappropriation: Another risk associated with knowledge protection is misappropriation. Misappropriation refers to the unauthorized use or theft of intellectual property. This can occur when confidential information is leaked, trade secrets are stolen, or patents are infringed upon. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization,[90]misappropriation can result in significant financial losses for individuals and organizations.\n",
      "* Infringement claims: Intellectual property owners can also face risks associated with infringement claims. Infringement occurs when someone uses intellectual property without permission or authorization, and the owner of the intellectual property files a lawsuit. Infringement claims can be costly and time-consuming and can result in damage to an individual's or organization's reputation. As noted by Law Insider's Knowledge of infringement Sample Clauses,[91]infringement claims can also result in financial penalties and even criminal prosecution.\n",
      "* Inadequate protection: Inadequate protection of intellectual property is also a significant risk. This occurs when intellectual property owners fail to properly protect their knowledge, such as by failing to obtain patents, trademarks, or copyrights. Inadequate protection can result in the loss of intellectual property rights and can make it difficult for individuals and organizations to enforce their rights in court. As noted by the WIPO,[90]inadequate protection can also make it easier for others to copy or steal intellectual property.\n",
      "In conclusion, protecting knowledge is crucial to promote innovation and creativity, but it is not without its risks. Overprotection, misappropriation, infringement claims, and inadequate protection are all risks associated with knowledge protection. Individuals and organizations should take steps to protect their intellectual property while also considering the potential risks and benefits of such protection.\n",

      "Library science(previously termedlibrary studiesandlibrary economy)[note 1]is aninterdisciplinaryor multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools ofmanagement,information technology,education, and other areas tolibraries; the collection, organization,preservation, anddisseminationof information resources; and thepolitical economyof information.[citation needed]MartinSchrettinger, a Bavarianlibrarian, coined the discipline within his work (18081828)Versuch eines vollstndigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschftsfhrung eines Bibliothekars.[8]Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.[9]The first American school for library science was founded byMelvil DeweyatColumbia Universityin 1887.[10]\n",
      "Historically, library science has also includedarchival science.[11]This includes: how information resources are organized to serve the needs of selected user groups; how people interact with classification systems and technology; how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally; how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries; theethicsthat guide library service and organization; the legal status oflibrariesand information resources; and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation andrecords management.\n",

      "Becoming a library staff member does not always need a degree, and in some contexts the difference between being a library staff member and a librarian is the level of education.[13][14]Most professional library jobs require a professional degree in library science or equivalent. In the United States andCanadathe certification usually comes from a master's degree granted by anALA-accredited institution.[15]In Australia, a number of institutions offer degrees accepted by theALIA (Australian Library and Information Association).[16]Global standards of accreditation or certification in librarianship have yet to be developed.[17]\n",

Many archivists are also trained historians specializing in the period covered by the archive. There have been attempts to revive the concept ofdocumentationand to speak ofLibrary, information and documentationstudies (or science).[22]\n",
      "The archival mission includes three major goals: To identify papers and records with enduring value, preserve the identified papers, and make the papers available to others.[23]While libraries receive items individually, archival items will usually become part of the archive's collection as a cohesive group.[23]Major difference in collections is that library collections typically comprise published items (books, magazines, etc.), while archival collections are usually unpublished works (letters, diaries, etc.). Library collections are created by many individuals, as each author and illustrator create their own publication; in contrast, an archive usually collects the records of one person, family, institution, or organization, so the archival items will have fewer sources of authors.[23]\n",
      "Behavior in an archive differs from behavior in other libraries. In most libraries, items are openly available to the public.

      "William Stetson Merrill'sA Code for Classifiers, released in several editions from 1914 to 1939,[37]is an example of a more pragmatic approach, where arguments stemming from in-depth knowledge about each field of study are employed to recommend a system of classification. While Ranganathan's approach was philosophical, it was also tied more to the day-to-day business of running a library. A reworking of Ranganathan's laws was published in 1995 which removes the constant references to books.Michael Gorman'sOur Enduring Values: Librarianship in the 21st Centuryfeatures the eight principles necessary by library professionals and incorporates knowledge and information in all their forms, allowing for digital information to be considered.\n",

By the 1990s almost all library schools in the US had added information science to their names. Although there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world.

      "1. ^Dewey Decimal Classification(DDC) used the term \"library economy\" for class 19 in its first edition from 1876. In the second edition (and all subsequent editions) it was moved to class 20. The term \"library economy\" was used until (and including) the 14th edition (1942). From the 15th edition (1951) class 20 was termed library science, which was used until (and including) 17th edition (1965) when it was replaced by \"library and information sciences\" (LIS) from the 18th edition (1971) and forward.\n",

      "Machine learning(ML) is afield of studyinartificial intelligenceconcerned with the development and study ofstatistical algorithmsthat can learn fromdataandgeneraliseto unseen data, and thus performtaskswithout explicitinstructions.[1]Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field ofdeep learninghave allowedneural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.[2]\n",
      "ML finds application in many fields, includingnatural language processing,computer vision,speech recognition,email filtering,agriculture, andmedicine.[3][4]The application of ML to business problems is known aspredictive analytics.\n",
      "Statisticsandmathematical optimisation(mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning.Data miningis a related field of study, focusing onexploratory data analysis(EDA) viaunsupervised learning.[6][7]\n",
      "From a theoretical viewpoint,probably approximately correct learningprovides a framework for describing machine learning.\n",
      "History\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "See also:Timeline of machine learning\n",
      "The termmachine learningwas coined in 1959 byArthur Samuel, anIBMemployee and pioneer in the field ofcomputer gamingandartificial intelligence.[8][9]The synonymself-teaching computerswas also used in this time period.[10][11]\n",
      "The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s whenArthur Samuelinvented acomputer programthat calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[12]In 1949,CanadianpsychologistDonald Hebbpublished the bookThe Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced atheoretical neural structureformed by certain interactions amongnerve cells.[13]Hebb's model ofneuronsinteracting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, orartificial neuronsused by computers to communicate data.[12]Other researchers who have studied humancognitive systemscontributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logicianWalter PittsandWarren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up withalgorithmsthat mirror human thought processes.[12]\n",
      "By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" withpunched tapememory, called Cybertron, had been developed byRaytheon Companyto analysesonarsignals,electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentaryreinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14]A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15]Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16]In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that anartificial neural networklearns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17]\n",
      "Tom M. Mitchellprovided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experienceEwith respect to some class of tasksTand performance measurePif its performance at tasks inT, as measured byP, improves with experienceE.\"[18]This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentallyoperational definitionrather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This followsAlan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19]\n",
      "Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20]\n",

      "Deep learningis a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset ofartificial intelligence.[21]\n",
      "As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest forartificial intelligence(AI). In the early days of AI as anacademic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostlyperceptronsandother modelsthat were later found to be reinventions of thegeneralised linear modelsof statistics.[22]Probabilistic reasoningwas also employed, especially inautomated medical diagnosis.[23]:?488?\n",
      "However, an increasing emphasis on thelogical, knowledge-based approachcaused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]:?488?By 1980,expert systemshad come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.[24]Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading toinductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, inpattern recognitionandinformation retrieval.[23]:?708710,?755?Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI andcomputer sciencearound the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines includingJohn Hopfield,David Rumelhart, andGeoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention ofbackpropagation.[23]:?25?\n",
      "Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from thesymbolic approachesit had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics,fuzzy logic, andprobability theory.[24]\n",
      "Data compression\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "This section is an excerpt fromData compression  Machine learning.[edit]\n",
      "There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts theposterior probabilitiesof a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by usingarithmetic codingon the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27]\n",
      "An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicitfeature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ?, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28]\n",
      "According toAIXItheory, a connection more directly explained inHutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n",
      "Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software includeNVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29]Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression includeOpenCV,TensorFlow,MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30]\n",
      "Inunsupervised machine learning,k-means clusteringcan be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such asimage compression.[31]\n",
      "Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by thecentroidof its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial inimageandsignal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32]\n",
      "Large language models(LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated byDeepMind's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such asPortable Network Graphics(PNG) for images andFree Lossless Audio Codec(FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.[33][34]\n",

Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals,ECML PKDDbeing a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability toreproduce knownknowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previouslyunknownknowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n",

In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by anarrayor vector, sometimes called afeature vector, and the training data is represented by amatrix. Throughiterative optimisationof anobjective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[49]An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.

Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations.

This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manualfeature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n",

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.

Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection).

      "Training models\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representativesampleof data. Data from the training set can be as varied as acorpus of text, a collection of images,sensordata, and data collected from individual users of a service.Overfittingis something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives.Algorithmic biasis a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\n",

      "Federated learning is an adapted form ofdistributed artificial intelligenceto training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example,Gboarduses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back toGoogle.[102]\n",

      "In 2006, the media-services providerNetflixheld the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers fromAT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built anensemble modelto win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[105]Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[106]In 2010, an article inThe Wall Street Journalnoted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the2008 financial crisis.[107]In 2012, co-founder ofSun Microsystems,Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[108]In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.[109]In 2019Springer Naturepublished the first research book created using machine learning.[110]In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[111]Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.[112]Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.[113][114][115]When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns withoutoverfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques likeOLS.[116]\n",
      "Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[117]\n",
      "Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[118][119][120]Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[121][122]\n",
      "Machine learning is also emerging as a promising tool in geotechnical engineering, where it is used to support tasks such as ground classification, hazard prediction, and site characterization. Recent research emphasizes a move toward data-centric methods in this field, where machine learning is not a replacement for engineering judgment, but a way to enhance it using site-specific data and patterns.[123]\n",
      "Limitations\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[124][125][126]Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[127]\n",
      "The \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[128]The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[128]\n",
      "In 2018, a self-driving car fromUberfailed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[129]Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with theIBM Watsonsystem failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[130][131]Microsoft'sBing Chatchatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[132]\n",
      "Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.[133]\n",
      "Explainability\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Explainable artificial intelligence\n",
      "Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[134]It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[135]By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\n",
      "Overfitting\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Overfitting\n",
      "The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.\n",
      "Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[136]\n",
      "Other limitations and vulnerabilities\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[137]A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[138][139]\n",
      "Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[140]Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion viaadversarial machine learning.[141]\n",
      "Researchers have demonstrated howbackdoorscan be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type ofdata/software transparencyis provided, possibly includingwhite-box access.[142][143][144]\n",
      "Model assessments\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like theholdoutmethod, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validationmethod randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods,bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[145]\n",
      "In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently reportsensitivity and specificitymeaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report thefalse positive rate(FPR) as well as thefalse negative rate(FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.[146]\n",
      "Ethics\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "This section is an excerpt fromEthics of artificial intelligence.[edit]\n",
      "Theethicsofartificial intelligencecovers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.[147]This includesalgorithmic biases,fairness,[148]automated decision-making,[149]accountability,privacy, andregulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such asmachine ethics(how to make machines that behave ethically),lethal autonomous weapon systems,arms racedynamics,AI safetyandalignment,technological unemployment, AI-enabledmisinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have amoral status(AI welfare and rights),artificial superintelligenceandexistential risks.[147]\n",
      "Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, likehealthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\n",
      "Bias\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Algorithmic bias\n",
      "Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[150]\n",
      "Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices.[151]For example, in 1988, the UK'sCommission for Racial Equalityfound thatSt. George's Medical Schoolhad been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.[150]Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[152][153]Another example includes predictive policing companyGeolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.[154]\n",
      "While responsiblecollection of dataand documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[155]In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, \"female faculty merely make up 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[156]Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[156]\n",
      "Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[157][158]Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on languagecorporawill necessarily also learn these biases.[159][160]In 2016, Microsoft testedTay, achatbotthat learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[161]\n",
      "In an experiment carried out byProPublica, aninvestigative journalismorganisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants\".[154]In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas.[162]Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems.[163]\n",
      "Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[164]Concern forfairnessin machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, includingFei-Fei Li, who said that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, andmost importantlyit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[165]\n",
      "Financial incentives\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[166]\n",
      "Hardware\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for trainingdeep neural networks(a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[167]By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[168]OpenAIestimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects fromAlexNet(2012) toAlphaZero(2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[169][170]\n",
      "Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)are specialised hardware accelerators developed byGooglespecifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purposeGPUsandFPGAs, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.[171]Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments.\n",
      "Neuromorphic computing\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Neuromorphic computingrefers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures.[172]\n",
      "Physical neural networks\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Aphysical neural networkis a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function ofneural synapses. The term \"physical neural network\" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.[173][174]\n",
      "Embedded machine learning\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed onembedded systemswith limited computing resources, such aswearable computers,edge devicesandmicrocontrollers.[175][176][177][178]Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such ashardware acceleration,[179][180]approximate computing,[181]and model optimisation.[182][183]Common optimisation techniques includepruning,quantisation,knowledge distillation, low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.\n",

      "Amemory holeis any mechanism for the deliberate alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts or other records, such as from awebsiteor other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened.[1]The concept was first popularized byGeorge Orwell's 1949dystopian novelNineteen Eighty-Four, wherethe Party'sMinistry of Truthsystematically re-created all potentially embarrassing historical documents, in effect, re-writing all of history to match the often-changing state propaganda. These changes were complete and undetectable.\n",
      "Origins\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "InNineteen Eighty-Four, the \"memory hole\" is a small chute leading to a largeincineratorused forcensorship:[2][3]\n",
      "In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a smallpneumatic tubefor written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.[4]\n",
      "Nineteen Eighty-Four's protagonistWinston Smith, who works in theMinistry of Truth, is routinely assigned the task of revising old newspaper articles in order to serve the propaganda interests of the government. In one instance, the weekly chocolate ration was decreased from 30 grams to 20. The next day the newspaper announced that the chocolate ration had not been reduced to 20 grams per week, butincreasedto 20 grams. Any previous mention of the ration having been 30 grams per week needed to be destroyed.\n",
      "The memory hole is referenced while O'Brien tortures Smith; O'Brien produces evidence of a coverup by the Party, exciting Smith that such documentation exists. However, O'Brien then destroys the evidence in the memory hole and denies not only the existence of the evidence but also any memory of his actions. Smith realizes that this isdoublethinkin action, as O'Brien has actively suppressed his memory of both a politically inconvenient fact and his action taken to destroy the evidence of it.[5]\n",

      "Organizational intelligence(OI) is the capability of an organization to comprehend and create knowledge relevant to its purpose; in words, it is the intellectual capacity of the entire organization. With relevant organizational intelligence comes great potential value for companies and organizations to figure out where their strengths and weaknesses lie in responding to change and complexity.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Organizational intelligence embraces bothknowledge managementandorganizational learning, as it is the application ofknowledge managementconcepts to a business environment, additionally including learning mechanisms, comprehension models, and business value network models, such as thebalanced scorecardconcept. Organizational intelligence consists of the ability to make sense of complex situations and act effectively, to interpret and act upon relevant events and signals in the environment. It also includes the ability to develop, share and use knowledge relevant to its business purpose as well as the ability to reflect and learn from experience\n",
      "While organizations in the past have been viewed as compilations of tasks, products, employees, profit centers, and processes, today they are seen as intelligent systems that are designed to manage knowledge. Scholars have shown that organizations engage in learning processes using tacit forms of intuitive knowledge, hard data stored in computer networks and information gleaned from the environment, all of which are used to make sensible decisions. Because this complex process involves large numbers of people interacting with diverse information systems, organizational intelligence is more than the aggregate intelligence of organizational members; it is the intelligence of the organization itself as a larger system.\n",
      "Organizational intelligence vs operational intelligence\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Organizational intelligence andoperational intelligenceare usually seen as subsets ofbusiness analytics, since both are types of know-how that have the goal of improving business performance across the enterprise. Operational intelligence is often linked to or compared withreal-time business intelligence(BI) since both deliver visibility and insight into business operations. Operational intelligence differs from BI in being primarily activity-centric, whereas BI is primarily data-centric and relies on a database (orHadoopcluster) as well as after-the-fact and report-based approaches to identifying patterns in data. By definition, operational intelligence works in real-time and transformsunstructured datastreamsfrom log files, sensor, network, and service datainto real-time, actionable intelligence.\n",
      "While operational intelligence is activity-focused and BI is data-focused, organizational intelligence differs from these other approaches in being workforce- or organization-focused. Organizational intelligence helps companies understand the relationships that drive their businessby identifying communities as well as employee workflow and collaborative communications patterns across geographies, divisions, and internal and external organizations.\n",
      "Information process\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "There are many aspects that organizations must consider in the three steps that they take to gain information. Without these considerations, organizations may experience strategic challenges.\n",
      "Acquiring information\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "First of all, organizations must acquire applicable information to make beneficial predictions. An organization must ask what they already know and need to know, they must also know the timeframe in which the information is needed and where and to find it. To make the best judgments, they must also evaluate the value of the information. Seemingly valuable information that costs more to find than gain from can hurt the company, if judged valuable, the organization must find the most efficient means of acquiring it.[1]\n",
      "Processing information\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "After acquiring the right information, an organization must know how to properly process it. They need to know how they can make new information more retrievable and how they can make sure that the information gets disseminated to the right people. The organization must figure out how to secure it and how long and if long, how they need to preserve it.[1]\n",
      "Utilization of information\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The last step includes the utilization of the information. An organization should ask themselves if they are looking at the right information and if so, if they are placing them in the right context. They must consider the possible environmental changes alter the informational value and determine all the relevant connections and patterns. Not forgetting to know if they are including the right people in the decision making process and if there are any technology that can improve the decision making.[1]\n",
      "Organizational ignorance\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "There are briefly four dimensions of problems that many organizations face when dealing with information. This is also referred to as organizational ignorance.\n",
      "Uncertainty\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization may be uncertain when it does not possess enough or the right information. To exemplify, a company may be uncertain in a competitive landscape because it does not have enough information to see how the competitors will act. This does not imply that the context of the situation is complex or unclear. Uncertainty can even exist when the range of possibilities is small and simple. There are different degrees of uncertainty. First of all an organization can be completely determined (complete certainty), have some probabilities (risk), probabilities estimated with lesser confidence (subjective uncertainty), unknown probabilities (traditional uncertainty) or undefined (complete uncertainty). However even with the lack of clarity, uncertainty assumes that the context of the problem is clear and well understood.\n",
      "Complexity\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization may be processing more information than they can manage. Complexity doesn't always correlate with vagueness or unpredictability. Rather, it occurs when there are too much or when the scope is too large to process. Organizations with complexity problems have interrelated variables, solutions and methods. Managing these problems is dependent of the individuals and the organizations. For instance, uninformed and novices must deal with each elements and relationships one by one but experts can perceive the situation better and find familiar patterns more easily. Organizations facing complexity must have the capacity to locate, map, collect, share, exploit on what the organizations need to know.\n",
      "Ambiguity\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization may not have a conceptual framework for interpreting the information. If uncertainty represents not having answers, and complexity represents difficulty in finding them, ambiguity represents not being able to formulate the right questions. Ambiguity cannot be resolved by increasing the amount of information. An organization must be able to interpret and explain the information in collective agreement. Hypotheses should be continuously made and discussed and key communication activities such as face-to-face conversations must be made. Resolving ambiguity in the earlier stages than competitors gives organizations much advantage because it helps organizations to make more appropriate and strategic decisions and have better awareness.\n",
      "Equivocality\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization may be having competing frameworks for interpreting a job. Equivocality refers to multiple interpretations of the field. Each interpretation is unambiguous but differ from each other and they may be mutually exclusive or in conflict. Equivocality result not only because everyone's experiences and values are unique but also from unreliable or conflicting preferences and goals, different interests or vague roles and responsibilities.\n",
      "Information organization and culture\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A culture of the organization describes how the organization will work in order to succeed. It can simply be described as the organization's atmosphere or values. Organizational culture is important because it can be used as a successful leadership tool to shape and improve the organization. Once the culture is settled, it can be used by the leader to deliver his/her vision to the organization. Moreover, if the leader deeply understands the organizational culture, he/she can also use it to predict a future outcome in certain situations.\n",
      "Control\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization with control culture is company oriented and reality oriented. They will succeed by controlling and keeping restrictions. The organization will value timeliness of information, security and hierarchical standardization. They make plans and maintain a process. This organization has stability, predictability and authority. For example, an organization with control culture can be monarchy.[2]\n",
      "Competence\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization with competence culture is company oriented and possibility oriented. They will succeed by being the best with exclusivity of the information. The organization values efficiency, accuracy and achievement. They look for creativity and expertise from the people in the organization. For example, an organization with competence culture can be...[2]\n",
      "Cultivation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization with cultivation culture is people oriented and possibility oriented. They will succeed by growing people, who fulfill the shared vision. The organization values self-actualization and brilliance. They also prioritizes the idea from people. For example, an organization with cultivation culture can be technological utopianism.\n",
      "Collaboration\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization with collaboration culture is people oriented and reality oriented. They will succeed by working together. The organization values affiliation and teamwork. They also prioritizes people in the organization. This organization has accessibility and inclusiveness of information. For example, an organization with collaboration culture can be anarchy.[2]\n",
      "Innovation\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An organization's leadership effectiveness is closely related to the organization's intelligence and innovation. There are six leadership factors that determine an organization's atmosphere: flexibility (how freely people can communicate with each other and innovate), responsibility (sense of loyalty to the organization), the standards set by people in the organization, appropriate feedback and rewards, the clear vision shared by people and the amount of commitment to the goal. Combination of these factors result in six different leadership styles: Coercive/Commanding, Authoritative/Visionary, Affiliative, Democratic, Coaching and Pacesetting.[3]\n",
      "Furthermore, organizational intelligence is a collection of individual intelligence. The leadership style of the organization and its atmosphere are related to the organization's innovation. Innovation happens when there are new information getting shared and processed efficiently in the organization.[4]\n",
      "Theories\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Round table\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "InKing Arthur's Round Table, Harvard professor David Perkins uses the metaphor of theRound Tableto discuss how collaborative conversations create smarter organizations.[5]The Round Table is one of the most familiar stories of Arthurian legend since it's meant to signal the shift in power from a king who normally sat at the head of a long table and made long pronouncements while everyone else listened. By reducing hierarchy and making collaboration easier, Arthur discovered an important source of powerorganizational intelligencethat allowed him to unite medieval England.\n",
      "Lawnmower paradox\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The lawnmower paradox, another metaphor from Perkins' book,[5]describes the fact that, while pooling physical effort is easy, pooling mental effort is hard. \"It's a lot easier for 10 people to collaborate on mowing a large lawn than for 10 people to collaborate on designing a lawnmower.\" An organization's intelligence is reflected by the types of conversationsface-to-face and electronic, from the mailroom to the boardroomwhich members have with one another. \"At the top, top level, organizational intelligence depends on ways of interacting with one another that show good knowledge processing and positive symbolic conduct.\"[5]\n",
      "Harold Wilenskyargued that organizational intelligence benefited from healthy argument and constructive rivalry.[6][7][8]\n",

      "Thelogic of information, also known as thelogical theory of information, considers the information content of logicalsignsand expressions along the lines initially developed byCharles Sanders Peirce.\n",

      "Later contributions to the field were made byFred Dretske,Jon Barwise,Brian Cantwell Smith, and others.\n",

      "[edit]\n",
      "More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s byLuciano Floridi, who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject.[2]\n",
      "Definitions of \"information\"\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The conceptinformationhas been defined by several theorists.[3]\n",
      "Charles S. Peirce's theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called thesemiotic, now a major part ofsemiotics. For Peirce, information integrates the aspects ofsignsandexpressionsseparately covered by the concepts ofdenotationandextension, on the one hand, and byconnotationandcomprehensionon the other.\n",
      "Donald M. MacKaysays that information is a distinction that makes a difference.[4]\n",
      "According to Luciano Floridi,[citation needed]four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as \"information\":\n",
      "* Information about something (e.g. a train timetable)\n",
      "* Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints)\n",
      "* Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions)\n",

Whilecomputer sciencebrings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress incomputer sciencewould only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies.\n",
      "Classical topics in philosophy, namely,mind,consciousness,experience,reasoning,knowledge,truth,moralityandcreativityare rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation incomputer science, e.g., in areas such as agent computing,software agents, and intelligent mobile agent technologies.[citation needed]\n",
      "According to Luciano Floridi \"[5]one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters:\n",
      "1. Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition ofthought experiment, a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computationalmodelingschemes to questions inlogic,epistemology,philosophy of science,philosophy of biology,philosophy of mind, and so on.\n",
      "2. Pancomputationalism: On this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level ofabstraction, anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:\n",
      "1. how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems?\n",
      "2. what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be aninformational system(or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)?\n",

      "Retroactive continuity, orretconfor short, is a literary device in fictional story telling whereby facts and eventsestablished through the narrative itselfare adjusted, ignored, supplemented, or contradicted by a subsequently published work that recontextualizes or breakscontinuitywith the former.[2]\n",
      "There are various motivations for applying retroactive continuity, including:\n",
      "* To accommodate desired aspects ofsequelsor derivative works which would otherwise be ruled out.\n",
      "* To respond to negative fan reception of previous stories.\n",
      "* To correct and overcome errors or problems identified in the prior work since its publication.\n",
      "* To change or clarify how the prior work should be interpreted.\n",
      "* To match reality, when assumptions or projections of the future are later proven wrong.[Note 1]\n",
      "Retcons are used by authors to increase their creative freedom, on the assumption that the changes are unimportant to the audience compared to the new story which can be told. Retcons can bediegeticor nondiegetic. For instance, by usingtime travelorparallel universes, an author may diegetically reintroduce a popular character they had previously killed off. More subtle and nondiegetic methods would be ignoring or expunging minor plot points to remove narrative elements the author doesn't have interest in writing.\n",
      "Retcons are common inpulp fiction, and especially incomic booksby long-established publishers such asDCandMarvel.[4]The long history of popular titles and the number of writers who contribute stories can often create situations that demand clarification or revision. Retcons also appear inmanga,soap operas,serial dramas, movie sequels,cartoons,professional wrestlingangles,video games, radio series,role-playing games, and other forms ofserial fiction.[5]\n",
      "Origins\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "An early published use of the phrase \"retroactive continuity\" is found in theologian E. Frank Tupper's 1973 bookThe Theology ofWolfhart Pannenberg: \"Pannenberg's conception of retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past, that the future is not basically a product of the past.\"[6]\n",
      "A printed use of \"retroactive continuity\" referring to the altering of history in a fictional work is inAll-Star Squadron#18 (February 1983) fromDC Comics. The series was set on DC'sEarth-Two, an alternative universe in whichGolden Agecomic characters age in real time.All-Star Squadronwas set duringWorld War IIon Earth-Two; as it was in the past of an alternative universe, all its events had repercussions on the contemporary continuity of the DC multiverse. Each issue changed the history of the fictional world in which it was set. In theletters column, a reader remarked that the comic \"must make you [the creators] feel at times as if you're painting yourself into a corner\", and, \"Your matching of Golden Age comics history with new plotlines has been an artistic (and I hope financial!) success.\" WriterRoy Thomasresponded, \"we like to think that an enthusiastic ALL-STAR booster at one ofAdam Malin'sCreation Conventionsin San Diego came up with the best name for it a few months back: 'Retroactive Continuity'. Has kind of a ring to it, don't you think?\"[7]\n",
      "Types\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Alteration\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Retcons sometimes add information that seemingly contradicts previous information. This frequently takes the form of a character who was shown to have died but is later revealed to have somehow survived. This is a common practice inhorror films, which may end with the death of a monster that goes on to appear in one or more sequels. The technique is so common insuperherocomics[2]that the term \"comic book death\" has been coined for it.\n",
      "An early example of this type of retcon is the return ofSherlock Holmes, whom writerArthur Conan Doyleapparently killed off in \"The Final Problem\" in 1893,[1][8][pageneeded]only to bring him back, in large part because of readers' responses, with \"The Empty House\" in 1903.\n",
      "The characterZorrowas retconned early in his existence. In the original 1919 novel,The Curse of Capistrano, Zorro ends his adventures by revealing his identity, a plot point that was carried over to the 1920 film adaptationThe Mark of Zorro. In order to have further stories starring Zorro, authorJohnston McCulleykept all the elements of his original story, but retroactively ignored its ending.\n",
      "One notable example isIsaac Asimovs 1950fixupnovelI, Robot, a collection ofscience fictionshort stories originally published inSuper Science StoriesandAstounding Science Fictionfrom 1940 to 1950. Compiled into a single publication byGnome Pressin 1950, the collection features aframing sequencein which the stories are told to a reporter by Dr.Susan Calvin, chiefrobopsychologistatU.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. Changes necessary to fit the new version included the name of the company (originally the Finmark Robot Corporation), new, earlier references to theThree Laws of Robotics, and new interpolated scenes featuring Dr. Calvin herself.\n",
      "The TV seriesDallasannulled its entire ninth season as just the dream of one of its characters,Pam Ewing. Writers did this to offer a supposedly plausible reason for the major character ofBobby Ewing, who had died onscreen at the end of season eight, to be still alive when actorPatrick Duffywanted to return to the series. This season is sometimes referred to as the \"Dream Season\" and was referred to humorously in later TV series such asFamily GuyandCommunityas a \"gas-leak year\". Other series such asSt. Elsewhere,Newhart, andRoseanneemployed the same technique.[9][10]\n",
      "Subtraction\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Unpopular stories are sometimes later ignored by publishers, and effectively erased from a series' continuity. Later stories may contradict the previous ones or explicitly establish that they never happened.[citation needed]In television, when a character is subtracted with a retcon, this is often known as \"Chuck Cunningham syndrome,\" after a character from the seriesHappy Daysthat was retconned out of existence shortly through the series run,[11]or \"going to Mandyville,\" afterMandy Hampton, a character that suffered a similar fate inThe West Wing.[12]\n",
      "Notable examples of subtractive retconning includeTerminator: Dark Fate(2019),which is a sequel to the first twoTerminatorfilms and ignores the events of every other film inthe franchise, andHalloween(2018), which is a sequel to only theoriginal filmand disregards all the other sequels.\n",
      "Stories that involvetime travelcan be used to undo the events of poorly received installments. AfterX-Men: The Last Stand(2006) faced criticism for abruptly killing off characters such asCyclopsandJean Grey, its sequel,X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014), features the characterWolverinetraveling back in time to 1973 to prevent an assassination that, if carried out, would lead to mutant extinction. The result of this is a new timeline where Jean and Cyclops never died.[13]\n",
      "Related concepts\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Retroactive continuity is similar to, but not the same as, plot inconsistencies introduced accidentally or through lack of concern for continuity; retconning, by comparison, is done deliberately. For example, the ongoing continuity contradictions on episodic TV series such asThe Simpsons(in which the timeline of the family's history must becontinually shifted forwardto explain why they are not getting any older)[14]reflects intentionally lost continuity, not genuine retcons. However, in series with generally tight continuity, retcons are sometimes created after the fact to explain continuity errors. Such was the case inThe Flintstones, whereWilma Flintstonewas mistakenly given two separate maiden names over the course of the series: \"Pebble\" and \"Slaghoople\".[15]\n",
      "Though the term \"retcon\" did not yet exist whenGeorge OrwellwroteNineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that \"Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally\" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change \"all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs\" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. \"Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.\" Seehistorical revisionism (negationism).\n",

      "Taxonomyis a practice and science concerned with classification or categorization. Typically, there are two parts to it: the development of an underlying scheme of classes (a taxonomy) and the allocation of things to the classes (classification).\n",
      "Originally, taxonomy referred only to theclassification of organismson the basis of shared characteristics. Today it also has a more general sense. It may refer to the classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such work. Thus a taxonomy can be used to organize species, documents, videos or anything else.\n",
      "A taxonomy organizes taxonomic units known as \"taxa\" (singular \"taxon\"). Many arehierarchies.\n",
      "One function of a taxonomy is to help users more easily find what they are searching for. This may be effected in ways that include alibrary classification systemand asearch engine taxonomy.\n",
      "Etymology\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "The word was coined in 1813 by the Swiss botanistA. P. de Candolleand is irregularly compounded from theGreek?????,taxis'order' and?????,nomos'law', connected by the French form-o-; the regular form would betaxinomy, as used in the Greekreborrowing?????????.[1][2]\n",
      "Applications\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Wikipedia categories form a taxonomy,[3]which can be extracted by automatic means.[4]As of 2009, it has been shown that a manually-constructed taxonomy, such as that of computational lexicons likeWordNet, can be used to improve and restructure the Wikipedia category taxonomy.[5]\n",
      "In a broader sense, taxonomy also applies to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such asnetwork structures. Taxonomies may then include a single child with multi-parents, for example, \"Car\" might appear with both parents \"Vehicle\" and \"Steel Mechanisms\"; to some however, this merely means that 'car' is a part of several different taxonomies.[6]A taxonomy might also simply be organization of kinds of things into groups, or an alphabetical list; here, however, the term vocabulary is more appropriate. In current usage withinknowledge management, taxonomies are considered narrower thanontologiessince ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.[7]\n",
      "Mathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is atree structureof classifications for a given set of objects. It is also namedcontainment hierarchy. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the general to the more specific.\n",
      "By contrast, in the context of legal terminology, an open-ended contextual taxonomy is employeda taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context. In scenarios taken from the legal domain, a formal account of the open-texture of legal terms is modeled, which suggests varying notions of the \"core\" and \"penumbra\" of the meanings of a concept. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the specific to the more general.[8]\n",
      "History\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Anthropologistshave observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study offolk taxonomiesismile Durkheim'sThe Elementary Forms of Religious Life. A more recent treatment of folk taxonomies (including the results of several decades of empirical research) and the discussion of their relation to the scientific taxonomy can be found inScott Atran'sCognitive Foundations of Natural History.Folk taxonomies of organisms have been found in large part to agree with scientific classification, at least for the larger and more obvious species, which means that it is not the case that folk taxonomies are based purely on utilitarian characteristics.[9]\n",
      "In the seventeenth century, the German mathematician and philosopherGottfried Leibniz, following the work of the thirteenth-century Majorcan philosopherRamon Llullon hisArs generalis ultima, a system for procedurally generating concepts by combining a fixed set of ideas, sought to develop analphabet of human thought. Leibniz intended hischaracteristica universalisto be an \"algebra\" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. The concept of creating such a \"universal language\" was frequently examined in the 17th century, also notably by the English philosopherJohn Wilkinsin his workAn Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language(1668), from which the classification scheme inRoget'sThesaurusultimately derives.\n",

      "Frederick Suppe[21]distinguished two senses of classification: a broad meaning, which he called \"conceptual classification\" and a narrow meaning, which he called \"systematic classification\".\n",
      "About conceptual classification Suppe wrote:[21]:?292?\"Classification is intrinsic to the use of language, hence to most if not all communication. Whenever we use nominative phrases we are classifying the designated subject as being importantly similar to other entities bearing the same designation; that is, we classify them together. Similarly the use of predicative phrases classifies actions or properties as being of a particular kind. We call this conceptual classification, since it refers to the classification involved in conceptualizing our experiences and surroundings\"\n",
      "About systematic classification Suppe wrote:[21]:?292?\"A second, narrower sense of classification is the systematic classification involved in the design and utilization of taxonomic schemes such as the biological classification of animals and plants by genus and species.\n",

      "[ ]\n",
      "Main articles:Is-aandHyponymy\n",
      "Two of the predominant types of relationships inknowledge-representationsystems arepredicationand the universally quantifiedconditional. Predication relationships express the notion that an individual entity is an example of a certain type (for example,John is a bachelor), while universally quantified conditionals express the notion that a type is a subtype of another type (for example, \"A dog is a mammal\", which means the same as \"All dogs are mammals\").[22]\n",
      "The \"has-a\" relationship is quite different: an elephanthasa trunk; a trunk is a part, not a subtype of elephant. The study of part-whole relationships ismereology.\n",
      "Taxonomies are often represented asis-ahierarchieswhere each level is more specific than the level above it (in mathematical language is \"a subset of\" the level above). For example, a basic biology taxonomy would have concepts such asmammal, which is a subset ofanimal, anddogsandcats, which are subsets ofmammal. This kind of taxonomy is called an is-a model because the specific objects are considered as instances of a concept. For example,Fidois-an instance of the conceptdogandFluffyis-acat.[23]\n",
      "Inlinguistics, is-a relations are calledhyponymy. When one word describes a category, but another describe some subset of that category, the larger term is called ahypernymwith respect to the smaller, and the smaller is called a \"hyponym\" with respect to the larger. Such a hyponym, in turn, may have further subcategories for which it is a hypernym. In the simple biology example,dogis a hypernym with respect to its subcategorycollie, which in turn is a hypernym with respect toFidowhich is one of its hyponyms. Typically, however,hypernymis used to refer to subcategories rather than single individuals.\n",

      "Knowledge organization\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Hull (1998) suggested \"The fundamental elements of any classification are its theoretical commitments, basic units and the criteria for ordering these basic units into a classification\".[26]\n",
      "There is a widespread opinion in knowledge organization and related fields that such classes corresponds to concepts. We can, for example, classify \"waterfowls\" into the classes \"ducks\", \"geese\", and \"swans\"; we can also say, however, that the concept waterfowl is a generic broader term in relation to the concepts \"ducks\", \"geese\", and \"swans\". This example demonstrates the close relationship between classification theory and concept theory. A main opponent of concepts as units is Barry Smith.[27]Arp, Smith and Spear (2015) discuss ontologies and criticize the conceptualist understanding.[28]:?5ff?The book writes (7): The code assigned to France, for example, is ISO 3166  2:FR and the code is assigned to France itself  to the country that is otherwise referred to as Frankreich or Ranska. It is not assigned to the concept of France (whatever that might be). Smith's alternative to concepts as units is based on a realist orientation, when scientists make successful claims about the types of entities that exist in reality, they are referring to objectively existing entities which realist philosophers call universals or natural kinds. Smith's main argument - with which many followers of the concept theory agree - seems to be that classes cannot be determined by introspective methods, but must be based on scientific and scholarly research. Whether units are called concepts or universals, the problem is to decide when a thing (say a \"blackbird\") should be considered a natural class. In the case of blackbirds, for example, recent DNA analysis have reconsidered the concept (or universal) \"blackbird\" and found that what was formerly considered one species (with subspecies) are in reality many different species, which just have chosen similar characteristics to adopt to their ecological niches.[29]:?141?\n",
      "An important argument for considering concepts the basis of classification is that concepts are subject to change and that they change when scientific revolutions occur. Our concepts of many birds, for example, have changed with recent development in DNA analysis and the influence of the cladistic paradigm - and have demanded new classifications. Smith's example ofFrancedemands an explanation. First,Franceis not a general concept, but an individual concept. Next, the legal definition of France is determined by the conventions that France has made with other countries. It is still a concept, however, as Leclercq (1978) demonstrates with the corresponding conceptEurope.[30]\n",
      "Hull (1998) continued:[26]\"Two fundamentally different sorts of classification are those that reflect structural organization and those that are systematically related to historical development.\" What is referred to is that in biological classification the anatomical traits of organisms is one kind of classification, the classification in relation to the evolution of species is another (in the section below, we expand these two fundamental sorts of classification to four). Hull adds that in biological classification, evolution supplies the theoretical orientation.[26]\n",
      "Ereshevsky\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Ereshefsky (2000) presented and discussed three general philosophical schools of classification: \"essentialism, cluster analysis, and historical classification. Essentialism sorts entities according to causal relations rather than their intrinsic qualitative features.\"[31]\n",
      "These three categories may, however, be considered parts of broader philosophies. Four main approaches to classification may be distinguished: (1) logical and rationalist approaches including \"essentialism\"; (2) empiricist approaches including cluster analysis. (It is important to notice that empiricism is not the same as empirical study, but a certain ideal of doing empirical studies. With the exception of the logical approaches they all are based on empirical studies, but are basing their studies on different philosophical principles). (3) Historical and hermeneutical approaches including Ereshefsky's \"historical classification\" and (4) Pragmatic, functionalist and teleological approaches (not covered by Ereshefsky). In addition, there are combined approaches (e.g., the so-calledevolutionary taxonomy\", which mixes historical and empiricist principles).\n",
      "Logical and rationalist approaches\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Logical division,[32]orlogical partitioning(top-down classification or downward classification) is an approach that divides a class into subclasses and then divide subclasses into their subclasses, and so on, which finally forms a tree of classes. The root of the tree is the original class, and the leaves of the tree are the final classes.Platoadvocated a method based on dichotomy, which was rejected byAristotleand replaced by the method of definitions based on genus, species, and specific difference.[33]The method of facet analysis (cf.,faceted classification) is primarily based on logical division.[34]This approach tends to classify according to \"essential\" characteristics, a widely discussed and criticized concept (cf.,essentialism). These methods may overall be related to the rationalist theory of knowledge. Michelle Bunn notes that logical partitioning uses categories which are establisheda priori; data is then collected and used to test the extent to which the classification system can be sustained.[35]\n",

      "\"Empiricism alone is not enough: a healthy advance in taxonomy depends on a sound theoretical foundation\"[36]:?548?\n",
      "Pheneticsornumerical taxonomy[37]is by contrast bottom-up classification, where the starting point is a set of items or individuals, which are classified by putting those with shared characteristics as members of a narrow class and proceeding upward. Numerical taxonomy is an approach based solely on observable, measurable similarities and differences of the things to be classified. Classification is based on overall similarity: the elements that are most alike in most attributes are classified together. But it is based on statistics, and therefore does not fulfill the criteria of logical division (e.g. to produce classes, that are mutually exclusive and jointly coextensive with the class they divide). Some people will argue that this is not classification/taxonomy at all, but such an argument must consider the definitions of classification (see above). These methods may overall be related to the empiricist theory of knowledge.\n",
      "Historical and hermeneutical approaches\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Genealogical classificationis classification of items according to their common heritage. This must also be done on the basis of some empirical characteristics, but these characteristics are developed by the theory of evolution. Charles Darwin's[38]main contribution to classification theory was not just his claim \"... all true classification is genealogical ...\" but that he provided operational guidance for classification.[39]:?9092?Genealogical classification is not restricted to biology, but is also much used in, for example, classification of languages, and may be considered a general approach to classification.\" These methods may overall be related to the historicist theory of knowledge. One of the main schools of historical classification iscladistics, which is today dominant in biological taxonomy, but also applied to other domains.\n",
      "The historical and hermeneutical approaches is not restricted to the development of the object of classification (e.g., animal species) but is also concerned with the subject of classification (the classifiers) and their embeddedness in scientific traditions and other human cultures.\n",
      "Pragmatic, functionalist and teleological approaches\n",
      "[ ]\n",
      "Pragmatic classification(and functional[40]and teleological classification) is the classification of items which emphasis the goals, purposes, consequences,[41]interests, values and politics of classification. It is, for example, classifying animals into wild animals, pests, domesticated animals and pets. Alsokitchenware(tools, utensils, appliances, dishes, and cookware used in food preparation, or the serving of food) is an example of a classification which is not based on any of the above-mentioned three methods, but clearly on pragmatic or functional criteria. Bonaccorsi, et al. (2019) is about the general theory of functional classification and applications of this approach for patent classification.[40]Although the examples may suggest that pragmatic classifications are primitive compared to established scientific classifications, it must be considered in relation to the pragmatic and critical theory of knowledge, which consider all knowledge as influences by interests.[42]Ridley (1986) wrote:[43]:?191?\"teleological classification. Classification of groups by their shared purposes, or functions, in life - where purpose can be identified with adaptation.

The frustration we shared was that while the elements did display many hallmarks of paradigmatic kindhood, elements were not the kinds of kinds that generated interesting challenges for classification in chemistry, nor even were they the kinds of kinds that occupied much contemporary critical chemical thought. Compounds, complexes, reaction pathways, substrates, solutions  these were the kinds of the chemistry laboratory, and rarely if ever did they slot neatly into taxonomies in the orderly manner of classification suggested by the Periodic Table of Elements. A focus on the rational and historical basis of the development of the Periodic Table had made the received view of chemical classification appear far more pristine, and far less interesting, than either of us believed it to be.\"[51]\n",

      "Organizational memory(OM), sometimes calledinstitutional memoryorcorporate memory, is the accumulated body of data, information, and knowledge created in the course of an organization's existence. The concept of organizational memory includes the ideas of componentsknowledge acquisition, knowledge processing or maintenance, and knowledge usage like search and retrieval.[1]Falling under the wider disciplinary umbrella ofknowledge management, it has two repositories: an organization'sarchives, including its electronic data bases; and individuals' memories.\n",
      "Organizational memory can only be applied if it can be accessed. To make use of it, organizations must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and members with good memory recall. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known asexperiential learningorevidence-based practice. In the case of individuals, organizational memory's accuracy is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouragedflexible labor markethas imposed anAlzheimer's-likecorporate amnesiaon organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.[2]\n",
      "Nature\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Organizational memory is composed of:\n",
      "* Prior data and information\n",
      "* All internally generated documentation related to the organization's activities\n",
      "* Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, brands, registered design, trade secrets and processes whose ownership is granted to the company by law, licensing and partnering agreements)\n",
      "* Details of events, products and individuals (including relationships with people in outside organizations and professional bodies),\n",
      "* Relevant published reference material\n",
      "* Institution-created knowledge\n",
      "Of these, institution-created knowledge is the most important.\n",
      "The three main facets of organizational memory aredata,information, andknowledge. It is important to understand the differences between each of these.\n",
      "Datais a fact depicted as a figure or a statistic, while data in contextsuch as in a historical time frameisinformation.\n",
      "By contrast,knowledgeis interpretative and predictive. Its deductive character allows a person with knowledge to understand theimplicationsof information, and act accordingly. The term has been defined variously by different experts:Alvin Goldmandescribed it asjustified true belief;[3]Bruce Aunesaw it asinformation in context;[4]Verna Alee defined it asexperience or information that can be communicated or shared;[5]and Karl Wiig said it wasa body of understanding and insights for interpreting and managing the world around us.[6]\n",
      "The wordknowledgecomes from the Saxon wordcnaw-lec. The suffixlechas become, in modern English,-like. So,knowledgemeans \"cnaw-like\", withcnawmeaning \"emerge\". Its best interpretation, then, is that it is an emergent phenomenon, an extension of existing erudition.\n",
      "Once knowledge is documented, it reverts to being information. New knowledgewhat some academics[who?]callknowledge in actionis that which is either created incrementally, accidentally, or through innovation.Incremental knowledgeis the product of prior experience that is already established and recognizedso-called \"organic learning\" that builds one experience on another (also known asexistentorhistorical knowledge). It is the most common form of learning. By way of a simple illustration, existent knowledge is the established awareness that, because it is hot, it is necessary to avoid sunburn and dehydration. Existent knowledge becomes new knowledge when (for example) a European on a summer vacation in Mexico, being used to wearing a cap on sunny days at home, decides to wear a sombrero.\n",
      "The second type of knowledge,accidental knowledge, happens unexpectedlysuch as what happened in 1928 when a mold spore drifted onto a culture dish in the laboratory of Scottish research scientistAlexander Flemingwhile he was on a two-week holiday. It seeded a blue moldpenicillinthat killed off a harmful bacterium.\n",
      "The third type of knowledge,innovative knowledge, is the labor of genius, such as the work ofLeonardo da Vinciwho, in the late 15th century, conceptualized cutting-edge ideas like the aeroplane, the parachute, cranes, submarines, tanks, water pumps, canals, and drills. Innovative knowledge encompasses the type of learning that leapfrogs the other types, andin da Vinci's casewas so advanced that it had to wait hundreds of years for incremental learning to catch up.\n",
      "The difference between explicit and tacit knowledge\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Tacit knowledge\n",
      "In its modern understanding, knowledge is made up ofexplicit knowledge, sometimes calledskilled knowledge; andtacitorcognitive knowledge(sometimes known as \"coping skills\"), a category first identified byMichael Polanyiin 1958.[7]\n",
      "Explicit knowledge is the \"what\" of know-how: knowledge such as the professional or vocational skills that are recorded in manuals, textbooks, and training courses.Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is the non-technical \"how\" of getting things donewhatEdward de Bono, the inventor oflateral thinking, callsoperacy, or the skill of action,[8]and whatPeter Druckeridentifies in the use of the wordtechne, the Greek for \"skill\".[9]Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, acquired largely by functional, context-specific experience. Typically existing only in the minds of individuals, tacit knowledge is normally difficult to capture, with most organizations depending almost entirely on the explicit knowledge. This makes experiential learning,productivitygains, andcompetitivenessslow and expensive to acquire. In business terms, tacit knowledge is a passive misnomer for active sharing of knowledge to make an organization more effective. Training programs, for instance, cannot be limited to a source-recipient model, and should leverage mutual exchanges across generations.[10]\n",
      "The reality is that even though most organizational work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially that to do with decision-making. The record often reflects the desire to gloss over disagreements and serious questions, or the desire to sell or excuse.\n",
      "Given the high levels ofcorporate amnesiain commerce and industry, some organizations are turning to new techniques to preserving their organizational memory and, in particular, their tacit knowledge. The latest capture tools to get attention are the traditionalcorporate history, usually produced once or twice every 100 years as a public relations medium; andoral debriefing, an augmentation of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic exit interview. Instead ofhagiography, organizational memory is being produced as an induction and educational tool that transmits long-term information. Oral debriefing, which concentrates on short- and medium-term memory, targets exiting and key occupant employees, recurring corporate events, and important projects in detailed testimony of participants. Both are designed to extract tacit knowledge in an easily accessible format that also generates the \"lessons of history\". Its permanent character also means that it does not have to be continually reproduced, just updated, and that its necessary re-interpretation alongside changing circumstances is predicated on a more reliable evidential base.\n",
      "How experiential learning works\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Experiential learning\n",
      "When it comes to experiential learning, an awareness of both the explicit and tacit components of organizational memory on their own is not generally enough to create new knowledge efficiently. As a general rule, it needs to be accompanied by a focused learning phase.\n",
      "Most models of experiential learning are cyclical and have three basic phases:\n",
      "1. Awareness of an experience or problem situation;\n",
      "2. A reflective phase within which the learner examines the OM around the experience and draws erudition from that reflection; and\n",
      "3. A testing phase within which the new insights or learnings, having been integrated with the learner's own conceptual framework, are applied to a new problem situation or experience.\n",
      "The concept's starting point[11]is that individuals or organizations seldom learn from experience, unless the experience is assessed and then assigned its own meaning in terms of individual and/or the organization's own goals, aims, ambitions, and expectations. From these processes come insights and added meaning, which is then applied to new circumstances. The end product is better decision-making.\n",
      "Types\n",

      "Records management, also known asrecords and information management, is an organizational function devoted to themanagement of informationin an organization throughout itslife cycle, from the time of creation or receipt to its eventual disposition. This includes identifying, classifying, storing, securing, retrieving, tracking and destroying or permanently preserving records.[1]TheISO15489-1: 2001standard (\"ISO 15489-1:2001\") definesrecords managementas \"[the] field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records, including the processes for capturing and maintainingevidenceof andinformationaboutbusinessactivities and transactions in the form of records\".[2]\n",
      "An organization's records preserve aspects of institutional memory. In determining how long to retain records, their capacity for re-use is important. Many are kept as evidence of activities, transactions, and decisions. Others document what happened and why.[3]The purpose of records management is part of an organization's broader function ofgovernance, risk management, and complianceand is primarily concerned with managing the evidence of an organization's activities as well as the reduction or mitigation of risk associated with it.[4]Recent research shows linkages between records management and accountability in governance.[5]\n",
      "Concepts of record\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The concept ofrecordis variously defined. TheISO 15489-1:2016definesrecordsas \"information created, received, and maintained as evidence and as an asset by anorganizationorperson, in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business\".[2]While there are many purposes of and benefits to records management, as this definition highlights, a key feature of records is their ability to serve as evidence of an event. Proper records management can help preserve this feature of records.\n",
      "Recent and comprehensive studies have defined records as \"persistent representations of activities\" as recorded or created by participants or observers.[6]This transactional view emphasizes the importance of context and process in the determination and meaning of records. In contrast, previous definitions have emphasized the evidential and informational properties of records.[7]In organizational contexts, records are materials created or received by an organization in the transaction of business, or in pursuit of or in compliance with legal obligations.[8][9]This organizational definition of record stems from the early theorization of archives as organic aggregations of records, that is \"the written documents, drawings and printed matter, officially received or produced by an administrative body or one of its officials\".[10][11]\n",
      "Key records management terminology\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "\n",
      "The examples and perspective in this articlemay not represent aworldwide viewof the subject.You mayimprove this article, discuss the issue on thetalk page, orcreate a new article, as appropriate.(March 2016)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\n",
      "Not all documents are records. Arecordis a document consciously (consciously means that the creator intentionally keeps it) retained as evidence of an action. Records management systems generally distinguish between records and non-records (convenience copies, rough drafts, duplicates), which do not need formal management. Many systems, especially for electronic records, require documents to be formallydeclared as a recordso they can be managed. Once declared, a record cannot be changed and can only be disposed of within the rules of the system.\n",
      "Records may be covered byaccess controlsto regulate who can access them and under what circumstances. Physical controls may be used to keep confidential records secure  personnel files, for instance, which hold sensitive personal data, may be held in a locked cabinet with a control log to track access. Digital records systems may include role-based access controls, allowing permissions (to view, change and/or delete) to be allocated to staff depending on their role in the organization. Anaudit trailshowing all access and changes can be maintained to ensure the integrity of the records.\n",
      "Just as the records of the organization come in a variety of formats, the storage of records can vary throughout the organization. File maintenance may be carried out by the owner, designee, a records repository, or clerk. Records may be managed in a centralized location, such as a records center or repository, or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity. Records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity, or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing. Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records.\n",
      "Aninactive recordis a record that is no longer needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of itsretention period, such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the retention schedule. Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation.\n",
      "Adisaster recovery planis a written and approved course of action to take after a disaster strikes that details how an organization will restore critical business functions and reclaim damaged or threatened records.\n",
      "Anactive recordis a record needed to perform current operations, subject to frequent use, and usually located near the user. In the past, 'records management' was sometimes used to refer only to the management of records which were no longer in everyday use but still needed to be kept  \"semi-current\" or \"inactive\" records, often stored in basements or offsite. More modern usage tends to refer to the entire \"lifecycle\" of records  from the point of creation right through until their eventual disposal.\n",
      "The format and media of records is generally irrelevant for the purposes of records management from the perspective that records must be identified and managed, regardless of their form. The ISO considers management of both physical and electronic records.[2]Also, section DL1.105 of theUnited States Department of DefensestandardDoD 5015.02-STD(2007) defines Records Management as \"the planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities involving the life cycle of information, including creation, maintenance (use, storage, retrieval), and disposal, regardless of media\".[12]\n",

      "Therecords life-cycleconsists of discrete phases covering the life span of a record from its creation to its final disposition. In the creation phase, records growth is expounded by modern electronic systems. Records will continue to be created and captured by the organization at an explosive rate as it conducts the business of the organization. Correspondence regarding a product failure is written for internal leadership, financial statements and reports are generated for public and regulatory scrutiny, the old corporate logo is retired, and a new one  including color scheme and approved corporate font  takes its place in the organization's history.\n",
      "Examples of records phases include those forcreationof a record,modificationof a record,movementof a record through its different states while in existence, anddestructionof a record.\n",
      "Throughout the records life cycle, issues such as security, privacy, disaster recovery, emerging technologies, and mergers are addressed by the records and information management professional responsible for organizational programs. Records and information management professionals are instrumental in controlling and safeguarding the information assets of the entity. They understand how to manage the creation, access, distribution, storage, and disposition of records and information in an efficient and cost-effective manner using records and information management methodology, principles, and best practices in compliance with records and information laws and regulations.\n",
      "Records continuum theory\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Main article:Records Continuum Model\n",
      "The records continuum theory is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities in relation to multiple contexts over space and time.\n",
      "Records management practices and concepts\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A records manager is someone who is responsible for records management in an organization.[citation needed]\n",
      "Section 4 of theISO 15489-1:2001states that records management includes:[2]\n",
      "* setting policies and standards\n",
      "* assigning responsibilities and authorities\n",
      "* establishing and promulgating procedures andguidelines\n",
      "* providing a range of services relating to the management and use of records\n",
      "* designing, implementing andadministeringspecialized systems for managing records\n",
      "* integrating records management into business systems and processes\n",
      "Thus, the practice of records management may involve:\n",
      "* planning the information needs of an organization\n",
      "* identifying information requiring capture\n",
      "* creating, approving, and enforcing policies and practices regarding records, including their organization and disposal\n",
      "* developing a records storage plan, which includes the short and long-term housing of physical records anddigitalinformation\n",
      "* identifying, classifying, and storing records\n",
      "* coordinating access to records internally and outside of the organization, balancing the requirements of business confidentiality,data privacy, and public access.\n",
      "* identification and maintenance of records per a specifiedretention period\n",
      "* executing a retention policy on the disposal of records which are no longer required for operational reasons; according to organizational policies, statutory requirements, and other regulations this may involve either their destruction or permanent preservation in anarchive.\n",
      "Records-management principles and automated records-management systems aid in the capture, classification, and ongoing management of records throughout their lifecycle. ARMA International defines records management as \"the field of management responsible for establishing and implementing policies, systems, and procedures to capture, create, access, distribute, use, store, secure, retrieve, and ensure disposition of an organization's records and information\". Such a system may be paper-based (such asindexcards as used in alibrary), or may involve a computer system, such as an electronic records-management application.[13]\n",
      "Defensible solutions\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Adefensible solutionis one that can be supported with clearly documented policies, processes and procedures that drive how and why work is performed, as well as one that has clearly documented proof of behavior patterns, proving that an organization follows such documented constraints to the best of their ability.[14]\n",
      "Whiledefensibilityapplies to all aspects of records life cycle, it is considered most important in the context of records destruction, where it is known as \"defensible disposition\" or \"defensible destruction\", and helps an organization explicitly justify and prove things like who destroys records, why they destroy them, how they destroy them, when they destroy them, and where they destroy them.[15]\n",
      "Classification\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Records managers use classification or categorization of record types to logically organize records created and maintained by an institution.[16]Such classifications assist in functions such as creation, organization, storage, retrieval, movement, and destruction of records.\n",
      "At the highest level of classification are physical versus electronic records. (This is disputable; records are defined as such regardless of media. ISO 15489 and other best practices promulgate a functions based, rather than media based classification, because the law defines records as certain kinds of information regardless of media.)\n",
      "Physical recordsare those records, such as paper, that can be touched and which take up physical space.\n",
      "Electronic records, also often referred to asdigital records, are those records that are generated with and used byinformation technologydevices.\n",
      "Classification of records is achieved through the design, maintenance, and application oftaxonomies, which allow records managers to perform functions such as the categorization, tagging, segmenting, or grouping of records according to various traits.[17]\n",
      "Enterprise records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Enterprise recordsrepresent those records that are common to most enterprises, regardless of their function, purpose, or sector. Such records often revolve around the day-to-day operations of an enterprise and cover areas such as but not limited litigation, employee management, consultant or contractor management, customer engagements, purchases, sales, and contracts.\n",
      "The types of enterprises that produce and work with such records include but are not limited to for-profit companies, non-profit companies, and government agencies.\n",
      "Industry records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Industry recordsrepresent those records that are common and apply only to a specific industry or set of industries. Examples include but are not limited to medical industry records (e.g., theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), pharmaceutical industry records, and food industry records.\n",
      "Legal hold records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Legal holdrecords are those records that are mandated, usually by legal counsel or compliance personnel, to be held for a period of time, either by a government or by an enterprise, and for the purposes of addressing potential issues associated with compliance audits and litigation. Such records are assignedLegal Holdtraits that are in addition to classifications which are as a result of enterprise orindustry classifications.\n",
      "Legal hold data traits may include but are not limited to things such as legal hold flags (e.g. Legal Hold = True or False), the organization driving the legal hold, descriptions of why records must be legally held, what period of time records must be held for, and the hold location.\n",
      "Records retention schedule\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "A recordsretention scheduleis a document, often developed usingarchival appraisalconcepts and analysis of business and legal contexts within the intended jurisdictions, that outlines how long certain types of records need to be retained for before they can be destroyed. For the retention schedule to be utilized a number of guidelines need to be put in place so as to be considered for implementation.[18]\n",
      "Managing physical records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Managing physical records involves different disciplines orcapabilitiesand may draw on a variety of forms of expertise.\n",
      "Identifying records\n",
      "If an item is presented as a legal record, it needs to be authenticated. Forensic experts may need to examine a document orartifactto determine that it is not aforgery, and that any damage, alteration, or missing content is documented. In extreme cases, items may be subjected to amicroscope,x-ray,radiocarbon datingor chemical analysis. This level of authentication is rare but requires that special care be taken in the creation and retention of the records of an organization.\n",
      "Storing records\n",
      "Records must be stored in such a way that they are accessible and safeguarded against environmental damage. A typical paper document may be stored in a filing cabinet in an office. However, some organisations employ file rooms with specialized environmental controls includingtemperatureandhumidity.Vital recordsmay need to be stored in a disaster-resistant safe or vault to protect against fire, flood, earthquakes and conflict. In extreme cases, the item may require bothdisaster-proofing and public access, such as the original, signedUS Constitution. Civil engineers may need to be consulted to determine that the file room can effectively withstand the weight of shelves andfile cabinetsfilled with paper; historically, somemilitaryvessels were designed to take into account the weight of their operating procedures on paper as part of theirballastequation[citation needed](modern record-keeping technologies have transferred much of that information to electronic storage). In addition to on-site storage of records, many organizations operate their ownoff-site records centersor contract with commercial records centres.\n",
      "Retrieval of records\n",
      "In addition to being able to store records, enterprises must also establish the proper capabilities for retrieval of records, in the event they are needed for a purpose such as an audit or litigation, or for the case of destruction. Record retrieval capabilities become complex when dealing with electronic records, especially when they have not been adequately tagged or classified for discovery.\n",
      "Circulating records\n",
      "Tracking the record while it is away from the normal storage area is referred to as circulation. Often this is handled by simple written recording procedures. However, many modern records environments use a computerized system involvingbar code scanners, or radio-frequency identification technology (RFID) to track the movement of the records. These can also be used for periodic auditing to identify the unauthorized movement of the record.\n",
      "Disposal of records\n",
      "Disposal of records does not always meandestruction. It can also include transfer to a historical archive,museum, or private individual. The large volumes of paper records and the inaccessibility of active paper records are some of the reasons that drive organizations to dispose or destroy records. Destruction of records ought to be authorized by law, statute, regulation, or operating procedure, and the records should be disposed of with care to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information. The process needs to be well-documented, starting with a records retention schedule and policies and procedures that have been approved at the highest level. An inventory of the records disposed of should be maintained, including certification that they have been destroyed. Records should never simply be discarded as refuse. Most organizations use processes including pulverization,paper shreddingor incineration.\n",
      "Commercially available products can manage records through all processes active, inactive, archival, retention scheduling and disposal. Some also utilize RFID technology for the tracking of physical file.\n",
      "Managing digital records\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "The general principles of records management apply to records in any format. Digital records, however, raise specific issues. It is more difficult to ensure that the content, context and structure of records is preserved and protected when the records do not have a physical existence. This has important implications for the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of records.\n",
      "Much research is being conducted on the management of digital records. TheInternational Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Projectis one example of such an initiative. Based at theSchool of Library, Archival and Information Studiesat theUniversity of British Columbia, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the InterPARES Project is a collaborative project between researchers all across the world committed to developing theories and methodologies to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and authenticity of digital records.\n",
      "Functional requirements for computer systems to manage digital records have been produced by theUS Department of Defense,[12]The United Kingdom's National Archivesand the European Commission,[19]whoseMoReq(Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records) specification has been translated into at least twelve languages funded by theEuropean Commission.\n",
      "Particular concerns exist about the ability to access and read digital records over time, since the rapid pace of change in technology can make the software used to create the records obsolete, leaving the records unreadable. A considerable amount of research is being undertaken to address this, under the heading ofdigital preservation. ThePublic Record Office Victoria (PROV)located in Melbourne, Australia published theVictorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS)which includes a standard for the preservation, long-term storage and access to permanent electronic records. The VERS standard has been adopted by all Victorian Government departments. A digital archive has been established by PROV to enable the general public to access permanent records. Archives New Zealand is also setting up a digital archive.\n",
      "Electronic tax records\n",
      "Electronic Tax Records are computer-based/non-paper versions of records required by tax agencies like theInternal Revenue Service. There is substantial confusion about what constitutes acceptable digital records for theIRS, as the concept is relatively new. The subject is discussed inPublication 583andBulletin 1997-13, but not in specific detail.\n",
      "Businesses and individuals wishing to convert their paper records into scanned copies may be at risk if they do so. For example, it is unclear if anIRSauditor would accept aJPEG,PNG, orPDFformat scanned copy of a purchase receipt for a deducted expense item.\n",
      "Current issues\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Compliance and legal issues\n",
      "While public administration, healthcare and the legal profession have a long history of records management, the corporate sector has generally shown less interest. This has changed in recent years due to new compliance requirements, driven in part by scandals such as theEnron/Andersenaffair and more recent problems atMorgan Stanley. Corporate records compliance issues includingretention periodrequirements and the need to disclose information as a result of litigation have come to be seen as important. Statutes such as the USSarbanesOxley Acthave resulted in greater standardization of records management practices. Since the 1990s the shift towards electronic records has seen a need for close working relations between records managers and IT managers, particularly including the legal aspects, focused on compliance and risk management.\n",
      "Security\n",
      "Privacy, data protection, andidentity thefthave become issues of increasing interest. The role of the records manager in the protection of an organization's records has grown as a result. The need to ensure personal information is not retained unnecessarily has brought greater focus to retention schedules and records disposal.\n",
      "Transparency\n",
      "The increased importance of transparency and accountability in public administration, marked by the widespread adoption offreedom of information laws, has led to a focus on the need to manage records so that they can be easily accessed by the public. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 required the government to publish a Code of Practice on Records Management for public authorities.[20]Similarly, European Union legislation on Data Protection and Environmental Information, requiring organisations to disclose information on request, create a need for effective management of such records.\n",
      "Adoption and implementation\n",
      "Implementing required changes to organisational culture is a major challenge, since records management is often seen as an unnecessary or low priority administrative task that can be performed at the lowest levels within an organization. Reputational damage caused by poor records management has demonstrated that records management is the responsibility of all individuals within an organization.\n",
      "An issue that has been very controversial among records managers has been the uncritical adoption ofelectronic document and records management systems.\n",
      "Impact of internet and social media\n",
      "Another issue of great interest to records managers is the impact of the internet and related social media, such aswikis,blogs,forums, and companies such asFacebookandTwitter, on traditional records management practices, principles, and concepts, since many of these tools allow rapid creation and dissemination of records and, often, even in anonymous form.\n",
      "Records life cycle management\n",
      "A difficult challenge for many enterprises is tied to the tracking of records through their entireinformation life cycleso that it's clear, at all times, where a record exists or if it still exists at all. The tracking of records through their life cycles allows records management staff to understand when and how to apply records related rules, such as rules for legal hold or destruction.\n",
      "Conversion of paper records to electronic form\n",
      "As the world becomes more digital in nature, an ever-growing issue for the records management community is the conversion of existing or incoming paper records to electronic form. Such conversions are most often performed with the intent of saving storage costs, storage space, and in hopes of reducing records retrieval time.\n",
      "Tools such asdocument scanners,optical character recognitionsoftware, andelectronic document management systemsare used to facilitate such conversions.\n",
      "Education and certification\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Many colleges and universities offer degree programs in library and information sciences which cover records management. Furthermore, there are professional organizations which provide a separate, non-degreed, professional certification for practitioners, the Certified Records Manager designation or CRM.\n",
      "Electronic records management systems\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "AnElectronic Document and Records Management Systemis acomputer programor set of programs used to track and store records. The term is distinguished fromimaginganddocument management systemsthat specialize in paper capture and document management respectively. Electronic records management Systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality tailored to the needs of records managers.\n",
      "TheNational Archives and Records Administration(NARA) has endorsed theU.S. Department of Defensestandard 5015.2 as an \"adequate and appropriate basis for addressing the basic challenges of managing records in the automated environment that increasingly characterizes the creation and use of records\".[21]Records Management Vendors can be certified as compliant with the DoD 5015.2-STD after verification from theJoint Interoperability Test Commandwhich builds test case procedures, writes detailed and summary final reports on 5015.2-certified products, and performs on-site inspection of software.[22]\n",
      "The National Archivesin the UK has published two sets of functional requirements to promote the development of the electronic records management software market (1999 and 2002).[23]It ran a program to evaluate products against the 2002 requirements. While these requirements were initially formulated in collaboration with central government, they have been taken up with enthusiasm by many parts of the wider public sector in the UK and in other parts of the world. The testing program has now closed; The National Archives is no longer accepting applications for testing. The National Archives 2002 requirements remain current.\n",
      "TheEuropean Commissionhas published \"MoReq\", the Model Requirements for Electronic Records and Document Management in 2001.[24]Although not a formal standard, it is widely regarded and referred to as a standard.[25][26][27][28][29]This was funded by the Commission's IDA program, and was developed at the instigation of theDLM Forum. A major update of MoReq, known as MoReq2, was published in February 2008.[30]This too was initiated by the DLM Forum and funded by the European Commission, on this occasion by its IDABC program (the successor to IDA).[31]A software testing framework and an XML schema accompany MoReq2; a software compliance testing regime was agreed at the DLM Forum conference in Toulouse in December 2008.\n",
      "TheNational Archives of Australia(NAA) published the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software (ERMS), and the associated Guidelines for Implementing the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software, as exposure drafts in February 2006.[32]\n",
      "Archives New Zealandpublished a 'discretionary best practice' Electronic Recordkeeping Systems Standard (Standard 5) in June 2005, issued under the authority of Section 27 of the Public Records Act 2005.[33]\n",
      "Commercial records centers\n",
      "[edit]\n",
      "Commercial records centers are facilities which provide services for the storage for paper records for organizations. In some cases, they also offer storage for records maintained in electronic formats. Commercial records centers provide high density storage for paper records and some offer climate controlled storage for sensitive non-paper and critical (vital) paper media. There is a trade organization for commercial records centers (for example, PRISM International), however, not all service providers are members.\n",
